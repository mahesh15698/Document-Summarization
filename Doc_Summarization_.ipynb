        "Actual_Summary = \"\"\" The preliminary findings from the G-7 and Paris Club countries' debt data sharing exercise, conducted in collaboration with the World Bank, were aimed at enhancing debt transparency, particularly for the world's poorest countries. The exercise was initiated by Japan as a contribution to promoting greater debt transparency. It served as the first step in reconciling debtor-reported information in the World Bank Debtor Reporting System (DRS) with comparable creditor data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Comprehensive and transparent public debt data are essential for informed and sustainable borrowing decisions, pricing sovereign risk, and ensuring government accountability. The World Bank has been at the forefront of promoting debt data transparency by collecting and compiling long-series, cross-country comparable data on external debt through the DRS. The DRS aligns with international standards and definitions, allowing for cross-country comparisons and measuring adherence to global norms.\n",
        "\n",
        "The World Bank's role extends beyond data collection; it also facilitates knowledge transfer on debt measurement, monitoring, and compilation. Additionally, the Bank coordinates with other institutions involved in financial flow information, such as the IMF, OECD, BIS, Commonwealth Secretariat, UNCTAD, and the Paris Club.\n",
        "\n",
        "Creditors play a crucial role in improving debt data quality and transparency. The G-20 endorsed the principles of information sharing and transparency in their Operational Guidelines for Sustainable Financing. However, the effectiveness of data reconciliation exercises depends on timely and transparent disclosure of detailed loan-specific information by creditors.\n",
        "\n",
        "The G-20 countries provided information to the World Bank on their bilateral claims to IDA-eligible countries in 2020, allowing for the reconciliation of their claims with DRS data. Japan stood out by providing comprehensive loan-by-loan data and engaging in dialogue with the World Bank to resolve discrepancies. This successful outcome prompted Japan to propose a new series of data sharing exercises among G-7 and Paris Club creditors to reconcile data on bilateral loans reported to the DRS. The exercise aimed to validate the accuracy of external debt data, enhance debt transparency, and strengthen debt strategies and sustainability analyses.\n",
        "\n",
        "Eighteen creditor countries, including G-7 countries and 11 Paris Club members, participated in the data sharing exercise. The focus was on public sector debt owed to official bilateral creditors, covering all levels of government, central banks, state-owned enterprises, and public entities. A reporting template formulated by the World Bank facilitated the sharing of detailed loan-by-loan information.\n",
        "\n",
        "The exercise involved comparing basic loan information and end-2021 debt stocks and transactions reported by creditors with DRS data. Reconciliation of loan numbers posed a challenge due to differing reporting norms between debtors and creditors. Despite this challenge, 80% of loans from G-7 countries and 78% of loans from other Paris Club creditors were successfully reconciled.\n",
        "\n",
        "In terms of debt stocks, creditors reported a total of $62.9 billion at end-2021, 10% higher than the DRS records. The G-7 countries reported a combined end-2021 debt stock of $55.1 billion, while other Paris Club creditors reported $7.8 billion. These findings highlight the importance of data reconciliation to ensure accurate and comprehensive debt reporting.\n",
        "\n",
        "The data discrepancies identified in the exercise highlight concerns about the ability of poorer countries to manage their public debt and the accuracy of their external liabilities. Further analysis and follow-up are needed to understand the reasons behind these discrepancies and develop measures to address them.\n",
        "\n",
        "In conclusion, the preliminary findings from the G-7 and Paris Club countries' debt data sharing exercise demonstrate the importance of debt transparency and the role of creditors in improving data quality. The exercise served as a step towards reconciling debtor and creditor records, enhancing debt transparency, and strengthening debt sustainability analyses. However, further efforts are needed to address data discrepancies and ensure accurate and comprehensive debt reporting for the world's poorest countries.\"\"\""

              "'High fuel prices hit BA\\'s profits\\n\\nBritish Airways has blamed high fuel prices for a 40% drop in profits.\\n\\nReporting its results for the three months to 31 December 2004, the airline made a pre-tax profit of Â£75m ($141m) compared with Â£125m a year earlier. Rod Eddington, BA\\'s chief executive, said the results were \"respectable\" in a third quarter when fuel costs rose by Â£106m or 47.3%. BA\\'s profits were still better than market expectation of Â£59m, and it expects a rise in full-year revenues.\\n\\nTo help offset the increased price of aviation fuel, BA last year introduced a fuel surcharge for passengers.\\n\\nIn October, it increased this from Â£6 to Â£10 one-way for all long-haul flights, while the short-haul surcharge was raised from Â£2.50 to Â£4 a leg. Yet aviation analyst Mike Powell of Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein says BA\\'s estimated annual surcharge revenues - Â£160m - will still be way short of its additional fuel costs - a predicted extra Â£250m. Turnover for the quarter was up 4.3% to Â£1.97bn, further benefiting from a rise in cargo revenue. Looking ahead to its full year results to March 2005, BA warned that yields - average revenues per passenger - were expected to decline as it continues to lower prices in the face of competition from low-cost carriers. However, it said sales would be better than previously forecast. \"For the year to March 2005, the total revenue outlook is slightly better than previous guidance with a 3% to 3.5% improvement anticipated,\" BA chairman Martin Broughton said. BA had previously forecast a 2% to 3% rise in full-year revenue.\\n\\nIt also reported on Friday that passenger numbers rose 8.1% in January. Aviation analyst Nick Van den Brul of BNP Paribas described BA\\'s latest quarterly results as \"pretty modest\". \"It is quite good on the revenue side and it shows the impact of fuel surcharges and a positive cargo development, however, operating margins down and cost impact of fuel are very strong,\" he said. Since the 11 September 2001 attacks in the United States, BA has cut 13,000 jobs as part of a major cost-cutting drive. \"Our focus remains on reducing controllable costs and debt whilst continuing to invest in our products,\" Mr Eddington said. \"For example, we have taken delivery of six Airbus A321 aircraft and next month we will start further improvements to our Club World flat beds.\" BA\\'s shares closed up four pence at 274.5 pence.\\n'"

              "      <td>Chris Evans back on the market\\n\\nBroadcaster Chris Evans has begun selling thousands of his possessions from a stall in Camden Market, London.\\n\\nEvans perched on a stool as shoppers wandered around the open-fronted shop packed with his furniture. Among the items from his homes in Los Angeles and London were countless sofas, chairs, pictures, beds and memorabilia from his past TV shows. Asked the reason for the sale, Evans said: \"I just want to get rid of it all, it's just a headache.\" He added: \"It feels good to be selling this stuff, it's a weight off my mind. \"Look at it all, there's so much clutter. I've enjoyed every bit of furniture and every poster but it's not important anymore.\" The normally gregarious Evans cut a peculiarly unshowbusiness-like figure as he sipped coffee and smoked cigarettes, wrapped in a big coat and scarf in front of his Aladdin's cave.\\n\\nHowever, the ostentation of some of the items on sale painted a picture of the eccentricity that endeared him to the British public in shows such as Channel 4's gameshow Don't Forget Your Toothbrush. The most striking thing about many of the pieces was their sheer size. Sofas looked like they could seat a small party and a bed seemed big enough for four. The elaborate nature of the pieces, many custom-made, had to be admired, particularly a huge red and gold upholstered \"throne\" and a stripy deckchair from the Queen Mary liner.\\n\\nTo help people in their browsing, Evans had given the pieces labels with not only the price but a helpful, often comic, aside. \"Isn't it great\" was the comment on the Â£1,950 throne and \"Bob Dylan's old sofa - honest\" was written on a dark wood couch priced Â£4,250.\\n\\nThe prices were steep by a lot of people's standards but Evans said it was not deterring shoppers. \"I've sold quite a lot already. Everything here is on sale for less than I bought it for but it's not really about the money. It's about getting rid of it all. We've all been bartering, that's what it's all about.\" He added that he was not going to reveal what he was going to do with the money he was making. Vintage TV and film posters also lined the walls, including a rare portrait of Raquel Welch and an original advertising print from the Benny Hill Show. And, almost hidden at the back of the lock-up, were the two giant toothbrushes from his former Channel 4 show, although these were not for sale.\\n\\nDespite the sheer curiosity value of the sale, there was a healthy trickle of interest from the public rather than the perhaps expected crowds. Some wandered in just to browse, as they would any of the other stalls, not knowing that it belonged to Evans.\\n\\nPaul Burgess said: \"I didn't realise. I thought it was just a load of junk. I should go back and have a better look.\" But local resident Francesca Detakats came specially to the stall and left happy with her purchase of an original 1960s photograph of The Who by David Wedgburg. Ms Detakats said she was a collector and did not mind paying Â£350 for the print. \"If you like something, you don't really count it like that,\" she said.\\n\\nMartin Hellewell, who had also made a point of visiting Evans' shop, said he thought it was a great idea. \"Why not, if you've got stuff to get rid of it's a good place to do it,\" said Mr Hellewell. Evans has taken out the stall with business partner Pete Winterbottom. They plan to open every day if possible, although Evans did not know how often he would be there. \"We'll stay definitely until Christmas and then maybe a week after that,\" said Evans.\\n</td>\n",

Law lords were \"simply wrong\" to imply the men were being held arbitrarily. New Home Secretary Charles Clarke vowed the nine men would remain in prison while the law was being reviewed.\\n\\nThe House of Lords ruled by an eight to one majority in favour of appeals by the men - dealing a major blow to the government's anti-terror policy.\\n\\nBut Mr Straw denied it amounted to a \"constitutional crisis\". He said those held had a right of appeal to the special immigration appeal tribunal and the decision to hold the suspects was upheld by that court. \"The law lords are simply wrong to imply that this is a decision to detain these people on the whim or the certificate of the home secretary,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. The foreign secretary insisted it was for Parliament, and not judges, to decide how best Britain could be defended against the threat of terrorism. But Liberal Democrat peer Lord Carlile, the government's independent reviewer of anti-terrorism laws, said it was possible some of the detainees could now be released. He said the Law Lords' ruling was an \"embarrassment\" for the government and major changes were needed to the law.\\n\\nThe ruling came on Charles Clarke's first day as home secretary following David Blunkett's resignation. In a statement to MPs, Mr Clarke said: \"I will be asking Parliament to renew this legislation in the New Year.\\n\\n\"In the meantime, we will be studying the judgment carefully to see whether it is possible to modify our legislation to address the concerns raised by the House of Lords.\" The detainees took their case to the House of Lords after the Court of Appeal backed the Home Office's powers to hold them without limit or charge. The government opted out of part of the European Convention on Human Rights concerning the right to a fair trial in order to bring in anti-terrorism legislation in response to the 11 September attacks in the US. Any foreign national suspected of links with terrorism can be detained or can opt to be deported. But those detained cannot be deported if this would mean persecution in their homeland. On Thursday, Lord Bingham - a senior law lord - said the rules were incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights as they allowed detentions \"in a way that discriminates on the ground of nationality or immigration status\" by justifying detention without trial for foreign suspects, but not Britons. Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead, in his ruling, said: \"Indefinite imprisonment without charge or trial is anathema in any country which observes the rule of law.\\n\\nIn a statement, detainee 'A' in Woodhill Prison said: \"I hope now that the government will act upon this decision, scrap this illegal 'law' and release me and the other internees to return to our families and loved ones.\" The case was heard by a panel of nine law lords rather than the usual five because of the constitutional importance of the case. Solicitor Gareth Pierce, who represents eight of the detainees, claimed the detention had driven four of the detainees to \"madness\", saying two were being held in Broadmoor hospital.\\n</td>\n",

              "0  Chris Evans back on the market\\n\\nBroadcaster Chris Evans has begun selling thousands of his possessions from a stall in Camden Market, London.\\n\\nEvans perched on a stool as shoppers wandered around the open-fronted shop packed with his furniture. Among the items from his homes in Los Angeles and London were countless sofas, chairs, pictures, beds and memorabilia from his past TV shows. Asked the reason for the sale, Evans said: \"I just want to get rid of it all, it's just a headache.\" He added: \"It feels good to be selling this stuff, it's a weight off my mind. \"Look at it all, there's so much clutter. I've enjoyed every bit of furniture and every poster but it's not important anymore.\" The normally gregarious Evans cut a peculiarly unshowbusiness-like figure as he sipped coffee and smoked cigarettes, wrapped in a big coat and scarf in front of his Aladdin's cave.\\n\\nHowever, the ostentation of some of the items on sale painted a picture of the eccentricity that endeared him to the British public in shows such as Channel 4's gameshow Don't Forget Your Toothbrush. The most striking thing about many of the pieces was their sheer size. Sofas looked like they could seat a small party and a bed seemed big enough for four. The elaborate nature of the pieces, many custom-made, had to be admired, particularly a huge red and gold upholstered \"throne\" and a stripy deckchair from the Queen Mary liner.\\n\\nTo help people in their browsing, Evans had given the pieces labels with not only the price but a helpful, often comic, aside. \"Isn't it great\" was the comment on the Â£1,950 throne and \"Bob Dylan's old sofa - honest\" was written on a dark wood couch priced Â£4,250.\\n\\nThe prices were steep by a lot of people's standards but Evans said it was not deterring shoppers. \"I've sold quite a lot already. Everything here is on sale for less than I bought it for but it's not really about the money. It's about getting rid of it all. We've all been bartering, that's what it's all about.\" He added that he was not going to reveal what he was going to do with the money he was making. Vintage TV and film posters also lined the walls, including a rare portrait of Raquel Welch and an original advertising print from the Benny Hill Show. And, almost hidden at the back of the lock-up, were the two giant toothbrushes from his former Channel 4 show, although these were not for sale.\\n\\nDespite the sheer curiosity value of the sale, there was a healthy trickle of interest from the public rather than the perhaps expected crowds. Some wandered in just to browse, as they would any of the other stalls, not knowing that it belonged to Evans.\\n\\nPaul Burgess said: \"I didn't realise. I thought it was just a load of junk. I should go back and have a better look.\" But local resident Francesca Detakats came specially to the stall and left happy with her purchase of an original 1960s photograph of The Who by David Wedgburg. Ms Detakats said she was a collector and did not mind paying Â£350 for the print. \"If you like something, you don't really count it like that,\" she said.\\n\\nMartin Hellewell, who had also made a point of visiting Evans' shop, said he thought it was a great idea. \"Why not, if you've got stuff to get rid of it's a good place to do it,\" said Mr Hellewell. Evans has taken out the stall with business partner Pete Winterbottom. They plan to open every day if possible, although Evans did not know how often he would be there. \"We'll stay definitely until Christmas and then maybe a week after that,\" said Evans.\\n   \n",

It was amateur,\" he added. \"The early goal in the second half gave us a mountain to climb and we never created the same kind of chances as we did in the first half. \"It's difficult to take positives from the game. We've let the fans down.\"\\n   \n",

Forty-two films will debut at Sundance, including The Liberace of Baghdad by British director Sean McAllister. The prestigious festival was founded by actor Robert Redford in 1981.\\n\\n\"We have always had an international component, but from next year they will enter a jury competition,\" festival director Geoffrey Gilmore said. \"We wanted to give world cinema more emphasis and have now put it on par with the American dramatic and documentary competitions.\" Twelve films competing in the new world cinema documentary category focus on countries and people under siege.\\n\\nThe Liberace of Baghdad features an Iraqi pianist hiding in a hotel as he waits for a visa, while Finnish film The Three Rooms of Melancholia looks at the war in Chechnya. Shake Hands With The Devil: The Journey of Romeo Dallaire tells of a UN mission to Rwanda during the 1994 genocide, while French-Israeli production Wall looks at Israel's controversial security wall separating it from the Palestinian territories. The 16 films competing in the new world cinema dramatic category include works from Germany, South Korea, Angola, China, Denmark and Australia.\\n\\nSeveral Hollywood stars feature in the festival's American independent drama category, including Keanu Reeves and Benjamin Bratt. Vince Vaughn stars in quirky movie Thumbsucker while 21 Grams actress Naomi Watts plays a budding Hollywood actress in Ellie Parker. The top Grand Jury prize at this year's festival went to low budget sci-fi thriller Primer, written and directed by Shane Carruth. Morgan Spurlock earned the directing award for Super Size Me, which became an international box office hit.\\n   \n",

In at number three was Iron Maiden for the Number Of The Beast and Erasure entered the chart at four with Breathe. Elvis's number one is the 999th in chart history and comes the day after what would have been his 70th birthday. Fans around the world held tribute events for the singer on Saturday, ranging from concerts to memorabilia exhibitions. Meanwhile, a poll carried out by royalty payments group the Performing Right Society found that The Wonder of You is the Elvis song most performed by live bands and tribute acts.\\n\\nRecord company SonyBMG are releasing Elvis's 18 number one singles at the rate of one a week in Britain, complete with original artwork and a collector's box. Hit single One Night will follow next week - with the chance of becoming the 1,000th number one as interest surrounding Elvis's birthday grows. Elsewhere in the singles charts, the Scissor Sisters went straight in at number five with Filthy/Gorgeous. Band Aid 20 slipped to six after seven weeks in the chart with Do They Know It's Christmas. The other two new entries are Dana Rayne with Object of My Desire at seven and Kasabian who are at number eight with Cut Off. Making up the top 10 are Boulevard of Broken Dreams by Green Day, down three places to number nine, and Out of Touch by Uniting Nations, also down three places to 10. In the album charts, the Scissor Sisters went to number one with their self-titled release, knocking Green Day's American Idiot to third place.

Law lords were \"simply wrong\" to imply the men were being held arbitrarily. New Home Secretary Charles Clarke vowed the nine men would remain in prison while the law was being reviewed.\\n\\nThe House of Lords ruled by an eight to one majority in favour of appeals by the men - dealing a major blow to the government's anti-terror policy.\\n\\nBut Mr Straw denied it amounted to a \"constitutional crisis\". He said those held had a right of appeal to the special immigration appeal tribunal and the decision to hold the suspects was upheld by that court. \"The law lords are simply wrong to imply that this is a decision to detain these people on the whim or the certificate of the home secretary,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. The foreign secretary insisted it was for Parliament, and not judges, to decide how best Britain could be defended against the threat of terrorism. But Liberal Democrat peer Lord Carlile, the government's independent reviewer of anti-terrorism laws, said it was possible some of the detainees could now be released. He said the Law Lords' ruling was an \"embarrassment\" for the government and major changes were needed to the law.\\n\\nThe ruling came on Charles Clarke's first day as home secretary following David Blunkett's resignation. In a statement to MPs, Mr Clarke said: \"I will be asking Parliament to renew this legislation in the New Year.\\n\\n\"In the meantime, we will be studying the judgment carefully to see whether it is possible to modify our legislation to address the concerns raised by the House of Lords.\" The detainees took their case to the House of Lords after the Court of Appeal backed the Home Office's powers to hold them without limit or charge. The government opted out of part of the European Convention on Human Rights concerning the right to a fair trial in order to bring in anti-terrorism legislation in response to the 11 September attacks in the US. Any foreign national suspected of links with terrorism can be detained or can opt to be deported. But those detained cannot be deported if this would mean persecution in their homeland. On Thursday, Lord Bingham - a senior law lord - said the rules were incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights as they allowed detentions \"in a way that discriminates on the ground of nationality or immigration status\" by justifying detention without trial for foreign suspects, but not Britons. Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead, in his ruling, said: \"Indefinite imprisonment without charge or trial is anathema in any country which observes the rule of law.\\n\\nIn a statement, detainee 'A' in Woodhill Prison said: \"I hope now that the government will act upon this decision, scrap this illegal 'law' and release me and the other internees to return to our families and loved ones.\" The case was heard by a panel of nine law lords rather than the usual five because of the constitutional importance of the case. Solicitor Gareth Pierce, who represents eight of the detainees, claimed the detention had driven four of the detainees to \"madness\", saying two were being held in Broadmoor hospital.\\n   \n",

Among the items from his homes in Los Angeles and London were countless sofas, chairs, pictures, beds and memorabilia from his past TV shows. Asked the reason for the sale, Evans said: \"I just want to get rid of it all, it's just a headache.\" He added: \"It feels good to be selling this stuff, it's a weight off my mind. \"Look at it all, there's so much clutter. I've enjoyed every bit of furniture and every poster but it's not important anymore.\" The normally gregarious Evans cut a peculiarly unshowbusiness-like figure as he sipped coffee and smoked cigarettes, wrapped in a big coat and scarf in front of his Aladdin's cave.\\n\\nHowever, the ostentation of some of the items on sale painted a picture of the eccentricity that endeared him to the British public in shows such as Channel 4's gameshow Don't Forget Your Toothbrush. The most striking thing about many of the pieces was their sheer size. Sofas looked like they could seat a small party and a bed seemed big enough for four. The elaborate nature of the pieces, many custom-made, had to be admired, particularly a huge red and gold upholstered \"throne\" and a stripy deckchair from the Queen Mary liner.\\n\\nTo help people in their browsing, Evans had given the pieces labels with not only the price but a helpful, often comic, aside. \"Isn't it great\" was the comment on the Â£1,950 throne and \"Bob Dylan's old sofa - honest\" was written on a dark wood couch priced Â£4,250.\\n\\nThe prices were steep by a lot of people's standards but Evans said it was not deterring shoppers. \"I've sold quite a lot already. Everything here is on sale for less than I bought it for but it's not really about the money. It's about getting rid of it all. We've all been bartering, that's what it's all about.\" He added that he was not going to reveal what he was going to do with the money he was making. Vintage TV and film posters also lined the walls, including a rare portrait of Raquel Welch and an original advertising print from the Benny Hill Show. And, almost hidden at the back of the lock-up, were the two giant toothbrushes from his former Channel 4 show, although these were not for sale.\\n\\nDespite the sheer curiosity value of the sale, there was a healthy trickle of interest from the public rather than the perhaps expected crowds. Some wandered in just to browse, as they would any of the other stalls, not knowing that it belonged to Evans.\\n\\nPaul Burgess said: \"I didn't realise. I thought it was just a load of junk. I should go back and have a better look.\" But local resident Francesca Detakats came specially to the stall and left happy with her purchase of an original 1960s photograph of The Who by David Wedgburg. Ms Detakats said she was a collector and did not mind paying Â£350 for the print. \"If you like something, you don't really count it like that,\" she said.\\n\\nMartin Hellewell, who had also made a point of visiting Evans' shop, said he thought it was a great idea. \"Why not, if you've got stuff to get rid of it's a good place to do it,\" said Mr Hellewell. Evans has taken out the stall with business partner Pete Winterbottom. They plan to open every day if possible, although Evans did not know how often he would be there. \"We'll stay definitely until Christmas and then maybe a week after that,\" said Evans.\\n</td>\n",

Law lords were \"simply wrong\" to imply the men were being held arbitrarily. New Home Secretary Charles Clarke vowed the nine men would remain in prison while the law was being reviewed.\\n\\nThe House of Lords ruled by an eight to one majority in favour of appeals by the men - dealing a major blow to the government's anti-terror policy.\\n\\nBut Mr Straw denied it amounted to a \"constitutional crisis\". He said those held had a right of appeal to the special immigration appeal tribunal and the decision to hold the suspects was upheld by that court. \"The law lords are simply wrong to imply that this is a decision to detain these people on the whim or the certificate of the home secretary,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. The foreign secretary insisted it was for Parliament, and not judges, to decide how best Britain could be defended against the threat of terrorism. But Liberal Democrat peer Lord Carlile, the government's independent reviewer of anti-terrorism laws, said it was possible some of the detainees could now be released. He said the Law Lords' ruling was an \"embarrassment\" for the government and major changes were needed to the law.\\n\\nThe ruling came on Charles Clarke's first day as home secretary following David Blunkett's resignation. In a statement to MPs, Mr Clarke said: \"I will be asking Parliament to renew this legislation in the New Year.\\n\\n\"In the meantime, we will be studying the judgment carefully to see whether it is possible to modify our legislation to address the concerns raised by the House of Lords.\" The detainees took their case to the House of Lords after the Court of Appeal backed the Home Office's powers to hold them without limit or charge. The government opted out of part of the European Convention on Human Rights concerning the right to a fair trial in order to bring in anti-terrorism legislation in response to the 11 September attacks in the US. Any foreign national suspected of links with terrorism can be detained or can opt to be deported. But those detained cannot be deported if this would mean persecution in their homeland. On Thursday, Lord Bingham - a senior law lord - said the rules were incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights as they allowed detentions \"in a way that discriminates on the ground of nationality or immigration status\" by justifying detention without trial for foreign suspects, but not Britons. Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead, in his ruling, said: \"Indefinite imprisonment without charge or trial is anathema in any country which observes the rule of law.\\n\\nIn a statement, detainee 'A' in Woodhill Prison said: \"I hope now that the government will act upon this decision, scrap this illegal 'law' and release me and the other internees to return to our families and loved ones.\" The case was heard by a panel of nine law lords rather than the usual five because of the constitutional importance of the case. Solicitor Gareth Pierce, who represents eight of the detainees, claimed the detention had driven four of the detainees to \"madness\", saying two were being held in Broadmoor hospital.\\n</td>\n",

              "0  Chris Evans back on the market\\n\\nBroadcaster Chris Evans has begun selling thousands of his possessions from a stall in Camden Market, London.\\n\\nEvans perched on a stool as shoppers wandered around the open-fronted shop packed with his furniture. Among the items from his homes in Los Angeles and London were countless sofas, chairs, pictures, beds and memorabilia from his past TV shows. Asked the reason for the sale, Evans said: \"I just want to get rid of it all, it's just a headache.\" He added: \"It feels good to be selling this stuff, it's a weight off my mind. \"Look at it all, there's so much clutter. I've enjoyed every bit of furniture and every poster but it's not important anymore.\" The normally gregarious Evans cut a peculiarly unshowbusiness-like figure as he sipped coffee and smoked cigarettes, wrapped in a big coat and scarf in front of his Aladdin's cave.\\n\\nHowever, the ostentation of some of the items on sale painted a picture of the eccentricity that endeared him to the British public in shows such as Channel 4's gameshow Don't Forget Your Toothbrush. The most striking thing about many of the pieces was their sheer size. Sofas looked like they could seat a small party and a bed seemed big enough for four. The elaborate nature of the pieces, many custom-made, had to be admired, particularly a huge red and gold upholstered \"throne\" and a stripy deckchair from the Queen Mary liner.\\n\\nTo help people in their browsing, Evans had given the pieces labels with not only the price but a helpful, often comic, aside. \"Isn't it great\" was the comment on the Â£1,950 throne and \"Bob Dylan's old sofa - honest\" was written on a dark wood couch priced Â£4,250.\\n\\nThe prices were steep by a lot of people's standards but Evans said it was not deterring shoppers. \"I've sold quite a lot already. Everything here is on sale for less than I bought it for but it's not really about the money. It's about getting rid of it all. We've all been bartering, that's what it's all about.\" He added that he was not going to reveal what he was going to do with the money he was making. Vintage TV and film posters also lined the walls, including a rare portrait of Raquel Welch and an original advertising print from the Benny Hill Show. And, almost hidden at the back of the lock-up, were the two giant toothbrushes from his former Channel 4 show, although these were not for sale.\\n\\nDespite the sheer curiosity value of the sale, there was a healthy trickle of interest from the public rather than the perhaps expected crowds. Some wandered in just to browse, as they would any of the other stalls, not knowing that it belonged to Evans.\\n\\nPaul Burgess said: \"I didn't realise. I thought it was just a load of junk. I should go back and have a better look.\" But local resident Francesca Detakats came specially to the stall and left happy with her purchase of an original 1960s photograph of The Who by David Wedgburg. Ms Detakats said she was a collector and did not mind paying Â£350 for the print. \"If you like something, you don't really count it like that,\" she said.\\n\\nMartin Hellewell, who had also made a point of visiting Evans' shop, said he thought it was a great idea. \"Why not, if you've got stuff to get rid of it's a good place to do it,\" said Mr Hellewell. Evans has taken out the stall with business partner Pete Winterbottom. They plan to open every day if possible, although Evans did not know how often he would be there. \"We'll stay definitely until Christmas and then maybe a week after that,\" said Evans.\\n   \n",

It was amateur,\" he added. \"The early goal in the second half gave us a mountain to climb and we never created the same kind of chances as we did in the first half. \"It's difficult to take positives from the game. We've let the fans down.\"\\n   \n",

Forty-two films will debut at Sundance, including The Liberace of Baghdad by British director Sean McAllister. The prestigious festival was founded by actor Robert Redford in 1981.\\n\\n\"We have always had an international component, but from next year they will enter a jury competition,\" festival director Geoffrey Gilmore said. \"We wanted to give world cinema more emphasis and have now put it on par with the American dramatic and documentary competitions.\" Twelve films competing in the new world cinema documentary category focus on countries and people under siege.\\n\\nThe Liberace of Baghdad features an Iraqi pianist hiding in a hotel as he waits for a visa, while Finnish film The Three Rooms of Melancholia looks at the war in Chechnya. Shake Hands With The Devil: The Journey of Romeo Dallaire tells of a UN mission to Rwanda during the 1994 genocide, while French-Israeli production Wall looks at Israel's controversial security wall separating it from the Palestinian territories. The 16 films competing in the new world cinema dramatic category include works from Germany, South Korea, Angola, China, Denmark and Australia.\\n\\nSeveral Hollywood stars feature in the festival's American independent drama category, including Keanu Reeves and Benjamin Bratt. Vince Vaughn stars in quirky movie Thumbsucker while 21 Grams actress Naomi Watts plays a budding Hollywood actress in Ellie Parker. The top Grand Jury prize at this year's festival went to low budget sci-fi thriller Primer, written and directed by Shane Carruth. Morgan Spurlock earned the directing award for Super Size Me, which became an international box office hit.\\n   \n",

In at number three was Iron Maiden for the Number Of The Beast and Erasure entered the chart at four with Breathe. Elvis's number one is the 999th in chart history and comes the day after what would have been his 70th birthday. Fans around the world held tribute events for the singer on Saturday, ranging from concerts to memorabilia exhibitions. Meanwhile, a poll carried out by royalty payments group the Performing Right Society found that The Wonder of You is the Elvis song most performed by live bands and tribute acts.\\n\\nRecord company SonyBMG are releasing Elvis's 18 number one singles at the rate of one a week in Britain, complete with original artwork and a collector's box. Hit single One Night will follow next week - with the chance of becoming the 1,000th number one as interest surrounding Elvis's birthday grows. Elsewhere in the singles charts, the Scissor Sisters went straight in at number five with Filthy/Gorgeous. Band Aid 20 slipped to six after seven weeks in the chart with Do They Know It's Christmas. The other two new entries are Dana Rayne with Object of My Desire at seven and Kasabian who are at number eight with Cut Off. Making up the top 10 are Boulevard of Broken Dreams by Green Day, down three places to number nine, and Out of Touch by Uniting Nations, also down three places to 10. In the album charts, the Scissor Sisters went to number one with their self-titled release, knocking Green Day's American Idiot to third place.

Law lords were \"simply wrong\" to imply the men were being held arbitrarily. New Home Secretary Charles Clarke vowed the nine men would remain in prison while the law was being reviewed.\\n\\nThe House of Lords ruled by an eight to one majority in favour of appeals by the men - dealing a major blow to the government's anti-terror policy.\\n\\nBut Mr Straw denied it amounted to a \"constitutional crisis\". He said those held had a right of appeal to the special immigration appeal tribunal and the decision to hold the suspects was upheld by that court. \"The law lords are simply wrong to imply that this is a decision to detain these people on the whim or the certificate of the home secretary,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. The foreign secretary insisted it was for Parliament, and not judges, to decide how best Britain could be defended against the threat of terrorism. But Liberal Democrat peer Lord Carlile, the government's independent reviewer of anti-terrorism laws, said it was possible some of the detainees could now be released. He said the Law Lords' ruling was an \"embarrassment\" for the government and major changes were needed to the law.\\n\\nThe ruling came on Charles Clarke's first day as home secretary following David Blunkett's resignation. In a statement to MPs, Mr Clarke said: \"I will be asking Parliament to renew this legislation in the New Year.\\n\\n\"In the meantime, we will be studying the judgment carefully to see whether it is possible to modify our legislation to address the concerns raised by the House of Lords.\" The detainees took their case to the House of Lords after the Court of Appeal backed the Home Office's powers to hold them without limit or charge. The government opted out of part of the European Convention on Human Rights concerning the right to a fair trial in order to bring in anti-terrorism legislation in response to the 11 September attacks in the US. Any foreign national suspected of links with terrorism can be detained or can opt to be deported. But those detained cannot be deported if this would mean persecution in their homeland. On Thursday, Lord Bingham - a senior law lord - said the rules were incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights as they allowed detentions \"in a way that discriminates on the ground of nationality or immigration status\" by justifying detention without trial for foreign suspects, but not Britons. Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead, in his ruling, said: \"Indefinite imprisonment without charge or trial is anathema in any country which observes the rule of law.\\n\\nIn a statement, detainee 'A' in Woodhill Prison said: \"I hope now that the government will act upon this decision, scrap this illegal 'law' and release me and the other internees to return to our families and loved ones.\" The case was heard by a panel of nine law lords rather than the usual five because of the constitutional importance of the case. Solicitor Gareth Pierce, who represents eight of the detainees, claimed the detention had driven four of the detainees to \"madness\", saying two were being held in Broadmoor hospital.\\n   \n",

        "updated_text = \"\"\"Preliminary Findings from th e      G - 7 and Paris Club  Countries  Debt  Data Sharing Exercise    World Bank, April 2023       This report sets out the rationale and preliminary findings of the data sharing  exercise between   G - 7  and the World Bank , which has been extended to  all   Paris Club creditors on a voluntary basis .   The exercise was   initiated by Japan as an important  contribution to  furthering the agenda for   greater debt transparency particularly regard ing  the world’s poorest countries.  T h e current   exercise  is the  first step  in the process of  reconciling information reported   by debto rs   to the World   B ank  Debtor Reporting System (DRS) with  the comparable  creditor   data .   As   a second  step, this   exercise could be institutionalized and extended to other creditors (in particular G20   creditors) in   order to improve data reporting in a permanent way.         I. Th e importance of  better debt data  transparency  and the World Bank’s role      Comprehensive,  accurate  and  transparent  public  debt  data  are  fundamental  to  the   management of public liabilities, and the foundation of informed and sustainable borrowing   decisions.  Knowing  what   is already owed is   essential for policymakers to make informe d   borrowing choices, creditors to appropriately price for sovereign risk, and citizens to hold their   governments accountable.   Critically, the availability of high - quality data is a pre - requisite for the   ability of national governments and the international   community to  make informed debt   sustainability analyses, to  minimize the risk of debt cris i s ,   and to take timely remedial action when   they occur.    T he World Bank has long played a leading role in promoting and delivering on greater debt data   transparency.   It collects and compiles the single verifiable source of long - series, cross - country   comparable data on the external debt of low -   and middle - income countries through the World   Bank Debtor Reporting System (DRS) . The DRS   requires regular (annua l and quarterly) and   detailed (loan - by - loan) information on external public and publicly external debt from all  World   Bank   borrowers. The Bank regards the external debt data it collects  through the DRS  as a global   public good and has disseminate d   comprehen sive information, updated on an annual basis, since   1973.     The  DRS  helps  ensur e   debt data conform to  international definitions and standards .  The   reporting  standards    of  the  DRS    accord  with  the  methodology  and  definitions  of  other   international  systems to which it links ,   i.e., the IMF Balance of Payments (BOP) and International   Investment Position (IIP) ,   and the System of National Accounts (SNA).  Thus, data drawn from the   DRS are  cross - country comparable  and the DRS also provides the  yardstick to   measure borrowers’   adherence to, or deviations from  international standards and definitions.  Th is is key  to ensuring   that  greater  debt transparency brings  more  clarity  and  not confusion from a proliferation of   data  compiled  in accordance with national standards that cannot be readily  compared .  Through 2       the process of managing the DRS and  related public  debt data collection systems , e.g.,  the   Quarterly External Debt Data and Quarterly Public Sector Debt Data, the World Bank has    established  a close and  continuous relationship with compilers in national debt offices ,   which   serves as an enabler  for   significant ‘knowledge transfer’ on how   to  measure, monitor and compile   public debt data. The World Bank  also  coordinates  closely with other institutions that compile   information on financial flows (the IMF, the OECD and BIS) ,   and with the Commonwealth   Secretariat (ComSec) and UNCTAD, the key providers of debt management software to low -   and   middle - income countries , as well a s the Paris Club.       II.  Operationalizing the  G - 20 Guidelines for Sustainable Financing    Creditors    have  the  potential  to  be    game  changers  in  improving  debt  data  quality  and   transparency .   The primary responsibility for  accurate, timely and  transparen t  recording   and   reporting   of public debt   lies with borrowers, but creditors have a   critical   contribution to make in   improving debt data quality and   advancing  the goal of greater debt  transparency.  C omprehensive   and systematic   reconciliation of  debtor   and  creditor  records  is an essential element of good   debt management   and  the  most effective and foolproof way of  validating the accuracy of  debt   data, resolving dis crepancies ,  and closing  data  gap s .   Regular data sharing and reconciliation  is   also  key to ensuring  debt sustainability analyses  drive from a solid account of  existing debt   obligations ,  mi nimiz ing   the risk of  debt reaching  unsustainable  levels , and  enabling debtors and   creditors to  quickly  take  appropriate  remedial action when  debt crises  occur.   However, the  ability   to  c onduct   these all - important  data  reconciliation exercises  is  dependent on  creditors  timely   transparent  disclosure of detailed  loan specific information on their lending activities.      The G - 20 countries endorsed the principles of information sharing and transparency by   creditors in their Operational Guidelines for Sustainable Financing 1   agreed in March 2017.

The   outcome of this data sharing exercise  was limited , primarily because of the low participation by   creditors and the propensity by creditors that did share information to provide only aggregate   data regarding the claims on debtor  countries and the amo u nt of debt service deferred.   Subsequently, the G20  International Financial Architecture (IFA)   Working Group launched a   voluntary stocktaking exercise of debt data shared with   International Financial Institutions (IIFs).

The Japanese authorities provided loan - by - loan  data    for all bilateral claims with comprehensive information on loan terms and transact ions.

As a result,   the DRS data for all IDA - eligible debtor countries   were  fully    reconciled  and  aligned  with  those  of  Japan  and  some  important  gaps  were  filled.   The  reconciliation  exercise  enabled  a  gap  of  $1.1  billion  for  Sudan  and  $226  million  for   Zimbabwe to be closed.    Building on thi s   success ful outcome , Japan proposed G - 7  countrie s  and Paris Club  creditors launch   a new series of data sharing exercises aimed at reconciling data on bilateral loans reported to the   DRS by DSSI - eligible countries with the comparable records of all G - 7 and Paris Club creditors,   beginning with end - 2021 da ta. They also encouraged other bilateral creditors to  participate and   share data on their bilateral lending to DSSI - eligible countries.       III. O bjective and  Key Findings from the G7 and Paris Club Data Sharing Exercise    The core objective of th e   exercise  is   to validate the coverage and accuracy of the external debt   data reported to the DRS and thereby enhance debt transparency and strengthen medium - term   debt strategies and debt sustainability analyses.   The data sharing exercise between G - 7 and   Pa ris Club bilateral creditors with the World Bank aimed at reconciling the debt data reported to   the World Bank DRS by IDA - eligible  countries   with the comparable information in the records of   the participating creditors. This data comparison  and reconciliat ion  is of particular significance  in   the case of  the se  countries .   Despite concerted efforts over the past decade to strengthen debt   management   capacity by national authorities, with support from their international partners,  for   many of them, the capacity  to comprehensively monitor and report on public debt remai ns weak.      Eigh teen   creditor countries participated in the data sharing exercise ,   the G - 7 co untries ( Canada,   France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom ,   and the United States of America) and  1 1   of   the other 15 permanent   Paris Club  member  countrie s   ( Australia,  Brazil,  Denmark,  Finland,  Israel,   Korea,  the Netherlands,  Norway,  Spain ,   Switzerland,  and Sweden ) , among which one member   country  provided a link to an online database, but the information was partial and pertained only   to loan agreements concluded in 2022.    The focus of the data comparison exercise was  on  public sector debt owed to official bilateral   creditors,   defined in accordance with international standards and definitions . The se include  the   sector classification of borrower and creditor   to which all DRS reporting countries adhere.   The   DRS    definition  of  e xternal  public  debt  encompass es     external  borrowing  by  all  levels  of   government and government agencies,  including the central bank, s tate  o wned  e nterprises,   d evelopment banks and other public entities ,  with or without a guarantee from the sovereign   government.  Official  bilateral  credito rs  constitute  sovereign  governments  and  all  public   institutions in which the government share is 50 percent or  more  and   including, as defined by the 4       SNA,   general government, central government ,   state and local government ,   central bank ,   and   public enterpris e.     The data sharing exercise was based on a  r eporting  t emplate  formulated by the World Bank in   consultation with creditors.  The  t emplate  asked for  detailed loan - by - loan information on the   bas ic   loan  information and  terms ,   including  date of the loan agreement,  the  borrower and   creditor entity   as recorded in the loan contract,  the name of  the contract  and currency  in which   financing is extended and/or  repa id ,   and the  loan  repayment terms including the interest rate. It   also asked credi tors to provide  loan - by - loan  information on end - 2021 debt stocks and related   2021 transactions   that include interest paid, principal and interest arrears ,   as well as late interest   paymen ts .   Participating creditors  shared detailed information on each bilateral loan extended to   IDA - eligible countries  in the format requested.     The c omparison of DRS data with the information reported by creditors was a two - fold exercise   that  looked  at  both  basic  loan  information  and  the     end - 2021  transactions.    The  broad   parameters of the comparison and the key findings are set out below.    ➢   Comparison of basic loan information reported by creditors with the DRS database.   The   primary identifier of a loan in the DRS and creditor records is the   loan number. However, the   loan number used by borrowers when reporting a loan to the DRS  is   different from the loan   number used by creditors in their own records. Therefore, each loan  had to be  “m atched ”    using the basi c   loan information (date of commitment, currency, loan terms ,   debt stock at   end - 2021 ,  etc.) for each loan in the  DRS  debtor data set   with the comparable loan information   provided by the creditor.  Creditors reported a total of  3,655   individual  loans of which  3,   358    were loans from G7 countries and  297   loans  from other Paris Club countries.   T h us far ,   80   percent of the loans  from  G - 7 countries  and 78 percent of those from  other participating   Paris Club creditors   have been reconciled with their counterpart in the DRS database.   A   major  challenge  of the reconciliation  exercise  derives from the   practice of some  creditors  to   account for and report  each  loan  tranche (disbursement)  as a  separate  loan   whereas debtors   typically report   one consolidated loan to the DRS .   Identifying the appropriate linkages is both   challenging and time - consuming and  the difference in reporting  norms by debtors and   creditors  is  also the  primary  reason   for why the total number of loans , 2,228   recorded in the   DRS ,   is much lower .     ➢   Comparison of end - 2021 debt stocks and 2021 transactions.   A second loan - by - loan  exercise   compared  the  debt stock position  at end - 2021  reported by debtors to the DRS with the   creditor records.  Creditors reported a total debt stock of $ 62.9  billion at end - 2021,  10   percent higher than the comparable  end - 2021  debt stock of $ 5 6. 4   billion recorded in the   DRS.   The  G - 7 countries  reported a  combined end - 2021 debt  stock of  $55.1   billion ,  10   percent higher than the   comparable   $50  billion recorded in the DRS.  The other participating   Paris Club creditors  reported a  combined end - 2021 debt stock  of  $7.8   billion,  22  percent   higher than the   $6.4  billion  reported to the DRS.  5       IV .   Understanding the  Data Discrepancies between DRS  Debtor  data and Creditor record s    T he  impetus for the data  reconciliation exercise   discussed in this report  was  concerns, widely   expressed by the international community,  about  the ability  of the  world’s  poorer countries  to   manage  their public debt   and  questions as to  whether  the   account of their external liabilities was   accurate and comprehensive.   The  preliminary finding s   of the on going exercise  and gap between   the debtor and creditor figures  may suggest these concerns  are   well - founded.   However, weak   debt management is  only  one of the   reasons for the  discrepanc y   between the data reported by   debtors  to t he DRS  and the comparable   information provided by creditors .  The c hallenges of   aligning  the  datasets  due  to  the  loan/tranche  format  of  reporting    are    discussed  above,   me thodological  inconsistencies     and    some    potential  double - counting     due  to  reporting  of   contingent liabilities   a re  other  key factors.   Some of the   principal issues   regarding the debtor   reports to the DRS and the creditor records are set out below.      Debtor - related  data   issues    ➢   Some  DRS data  is  estimated   not reported by the borrower .   DSSI - eligible  countries  often  strive   to overcome  debt management challenges that translate into limitations on the  capacity to   report viable, timely and comprehensive reports to the DRS .  System fa ilures, f ragility,  natural   disasters,    conflicts     and    crisis  situations  and    exogenous    factors  beyond  their    control    exacerbate these challenges .  In 2021 ,   5   of the se   7 7  IDA - eligible  countries  required to report   to the DRS were unable to meet the  reporting requirement and  countries  such as Syria and   Yemen have not reported for the past  5   years.  In cases of  non - reporting ,   the World Bank debt   team  estimates the DRS data  using other  available  sources of information.     ➢   The d ebtor   may   define  external public debt   more narrowly than  the DRS reporting mandat e.    This is typically  a definition  that includes only borrowing by the central government  and  public   entities that benefits from an explicit  sovereign  guarantee ,   and not the broader  international   definition  of external public debt  used by the DRS and elaborated in  S ection  III .   As such, some   of  State - Owned   Enterprises (SOE s ) external debt liabilities are not reported to the DRS.    ➢   Time lags  in recording  new  commitments   and  loan  disbursements  by national debt offices are   common .  These are reflective of  weak  monitoring procedures  at the national level   and   attributable   to   poor communication, inadequate  human resources ,  delays in entering data   into the debt recording system   and other institutional factors .   These delays have a knock - on   effect on DRS reporting  whi ch may record loan commitments and disbursements a year later   than the creditor record.    ➢   Late interest and penalty interest are rarely reported to the DRS.   Part of the reason for this   lies in lack of understanding of how late and penalty interest is calcula ted, which is often   complex and differs significantly amongst creditors. Limitations in debt management software   which do es   not always  provide   for  the  calculation and recording of interest penalties also   impede reporting.  6       Creditor - related data issues    ➢   Abse nce of a standardized methodology .   Creditors  that  participat e   in the data sharing exercise   all provided information in  accordance with the  agreed  reporting template . However, the data   themselves  are   compiled  in accordance with the national leg islative and  accounting   norms .   These  vary from one creditor to the  other  and   often do not accord to the international   standards and definitions that underpin the DRS ,   thereby  compromising both  intra - creditor   and debtor - creditor comparisons .    ➢   Potential double - countin g   due to the inclusion of contingent liabilities .     Some   creditors    included not only direct bilateral loans   in their reports  but also contingent liabilities . These   include  contingent liabilities  associated with export credit  guarantees   and   financing  of    common funds administered by multilateral institutions   for example the EEC - IDA Special   Account.   A   g uaranteed export credit   is captured in the DRS ,   but  as a direct obligation to the   private  entity that provided the loan .  Similarl y, the EEC - IDA Special Account is   included   in the   DRS  but     as  part  of    the  debtor’s  obligations  to  IDA .  The re     also  appears  to  be    some   overstatement of bilateral debt stocks in cases where a loan is undisbursed or only partially   disbursed but the entire  loan amount is recorded as outstanding .         V. N ext  S teps    The preliminary findings of the report indicate that much more needs to be done to complete the   reconciliation of the end - 2021 data recorded in the DRS with the creditor records. They also   confirm ,   however ,   that  for this work to advance in a meaningful and productive way , it  will require   a much closer interaction with creditors to overcome methodological issues   and   understand   precisel y   how each creditor accounts for their bilateral lending and relat ed debt restructuring and   debt service deferrals so data can be aligned with DRS standards and definitions for purposes  of    comparison.     As next step s ,  the World Bank  will   reach out to each of the participating creditors with the aim of   engaging them in an  open and ongoing dialogue . In doing so ,   it will  draw on the model of working   relations  established  with Japan in 2019 which enabled debtor and creditor data to be aligned   and gaps in the  DRS   records filled.  The   World Bank will also reach out to debtor coun tries with   major data discrepancies to ensure that they will reflect reconciled data  in  their database s   and   debt statistics as needed.     T he World Bank, together with the participating G - 7 and Paris Club creditors, will continue to   advocate the importance of data sharing and  to promote   the exercise  in various fora  to  the    creditors that   have not  yet shared data.  The World Bank  aims to  continu e   data sharing and   reconciliation  work with  support from a wider group of creditors, including those in the G20, with   a view to making regular data sharing and reconciliation an established practice.     \"\"\""

              "      <td>Preliminary Findings from th e      G - 7 and Paris Club  Countries  Debt  Data Sharing Exercise    World Bank, April 2023       This report sets out the rationale and preliminary findings of the data sharing  exercise between   G - 7  and the World Bank , which has been extended to  all   Paris Club creditors on a voluntary basis .   The exercise was   initiated by Japan as an important  contribution to  furthering the agenda for   greater debt transparency particularly regard ing  the world’s poorest countries.  T h e current   exercise  is the  first step  in the process of  reconciling information reported   by debto rs   to the World   B ank  Debtor Reporting System (DRS) with  the comparable  creditor   data .   As   a second  step, this   exercise could be institutionalized and extended to other creditors (in particular G20   creditors) in   order to improve data reporting in a permanent way.         I. Th e importance of  better debt data  transparency  and the World Bank’s role      Comprehensive,  accurate  and  transparent  public  debt  data  are  fundamental  to  the   management of public liabilities, and the foundation of informed and sustainable borrowing   decisions.  Knowing  what   is already owed is   essential for policymakers to make informe d   borrowing choices, creditors to appropriately price for sovereign risk, and citizens to hold their   governments accountable.   Critically, the availability of high - quality data is a pre - requisite for the   ability of national governments and the international   community to  make informed debt   sustainability analyses, to  minimize the risk of debt cris i s ,   and to take timely remedial action when   they occur.    T he World Bank has long played a leading role in promoting and delivering on greater debt data   transparency.   It collects and compiles the single verifiable source of long - series, cross - country   comparable data on the external debt of low -   and middle - income countries through the World   Bank Debtor Reporting System (DRS) . The DRS   requires regular (annua l and quarterly) and   detailed (loan - by - loan) information on external public and publicly external debt from all  World   Bank   borrowers. The Bank regards the external debt data it collects  through the DRS  as a global   public good and has disseminate d   comprehen sive information, updated on an annual basis, since   1973.     The  DRS  helps  ensur e   debt data conform to  international definitions and standards .  The   reporting  standards    of  the  DRS    accord  with  the  methodology  and  definitions  of  other   international  systems to which it links ,   i.e., the IMF Balance of Payments (BOP) and International   Investment Position (IIP) ,   and the System of National Accounts (SNA).  Thus, data drawn from the   DRS are  cross - country comparable  and the DRS also provides the  yardstick to   measure borrowers’   adherence to, or deviations from  international standards and definitions.  Th is is key  to ensuring   that  greater  debt transparency brings  more  clarity  and  not confusion from a proliferation of   data  compiled  in accordance with national standards that cannot be readily  compared .  Through 2       the process of managing the DRS and  related public  debt data collection systems , e.g.,  the   Quarterly External Debt Data and Quarterly Public Sector Debt Data, the World Bank has    established  a close and  continuous relationship with compilers in national debt offices ,   which   serves as an enabler  for   significant ‘knowledge transfer’ on how   to  measure, monitor and compile   public debt data. The World Bank  also  coordinates  closely with other institutions that compile   information on financial flows (the IMF, the OECD and BIS) ,   and with the Commonwealth   Secretariat (ComSec) and UNCTAD, the key providers of debt management software to low -   and   middle - income countries , as well a s the Paris Club.       II.  Operationalizing the  G - 20 Guidelines for Sustainable Financing    Creditors    have  the  potential  to  be    game  changers  in  improving  debt  data  quality  and   transparency .   The primary responsibility for  accurate, timely and  transparen t  recording   and   reporting   of public debt   lies with borrowers, but creditors have a   critical   contribution to make in   improving debt data quality and   advancing  the goal of greater debt  transparency.  C omprehensive   and systematic   reconciliation of  debtor   and  creditor  records  is an essential element of good   debt management   and  the  most effective and foolproof way of  validating the accuracy of  debt   data, resolving dis crepancies ,  and closing  data  gap s .   Regular data sharing and reconciliation  is   also  key to ensuring  debt sustainability analyses  drive from a solid account of  existing debt   obligations ,  mi nimiz ing   the risk of  debt reaching  unsustainable  levels , and  enabling debtors and   creditors to  quickly  take  appropriate  remedial action when  debt crises  occur.   However, the  ability   to  c onduct   these all - important  data  reconciliation exercises  is  dependent on  creditors  timely   transparent  disclosure of detailed  loan specific information on their lending activities.      The G - 20 countries endorsed the principles of information sharing and transparency by   creditors in their Operational Guidelines for Sustainable Financing 1   agreed in March 2017.  In   2020 G - 20 countries   provided information to the World Bank on their bilateral claims   to   IDA -  eligible   countries to facilitate an exercise to reconcile their bilateral claims with the data reported   to the DRS and ensure an accurate assessment of the impact of the debt deferral   initiative. The   outcome of this data sharing exercise  was limited , primarily because of the low participation by   creditors and the propensity by creditors that did share information to provide only aggregate   data regarding the claims on debtor  countries and the amo u nt of debt service deferred.   Subsequently, the G20  International Financial Architecture (IFA)   Working Group launched a   voluntary stocktaking exercise of debt data shared with   International Financial Institutions (IIFs).      Japan proved  an important exception and demonstrated the vital role creditors must play  to   meet the  goal of greater debt transparency.   The Japanese authorities provided loan - by - loan  data    for all bilateral claims with comprehensive information on loan terms and transact ions. Equally   importantly, they engaged in an open and ongoing dialogue with the World Bank on all the      1     G - 20  Operational Guidelines for Sustainable Financing -- Diagnostic Tool, November 15, 2019 .  3       discrepancies and anomalies identified between its records and the comparable data individual   borrower s   reported to the DRS. This enabled staff who manag e the DRS to follow - up with national   compilers in a coherent and meaningful way to identify the reason for data discrepancies and the   measures required to resolve them.  As a result,   the DRS data for all IDA - eligible debtor countries   were  fully    reconciled  and  aligned  with  those  of  Japan  and  some  important  gaps  were  filled.   The  reconciliation  exercise  enabled  a  gap  of  $1.1  billion  for  Sudan  and  $226  million  for   Zimbabwe to be closed.

A second loan - by - loan  exercise   compared  the  debt stock position  at end - 2021  reported by debtors to the DRS with the   creditor records.  Creditors reported a total debt stock of $ 62.9  billion at end - 2021,  10   percent higher than the comparable  end - 2021  debt stock of $ 5 6. 4   billion recorded in the   DRS.   The  G - 7 countries  reported a  combined end - 2021 debt  stock of  $55.1   billion ,  10   percent higher than the   comparable   $50  billion recorded in the DRS.  The other participating   Paris Club creditors  reported a  combined end - 2021 debt stock  of  $7.8   billion,  22  percent   higher than the   $6.4  billion  reported to the DRS.  5       IV .   Understanding the  Data Discrepancies between DRS  Debtor  data and Creditor record s    T he  impetus for the data  reconciliation exercise   discussed in this report  was  concerns, widely   expressed by the international community,  about  the ability  of the  world’s  poorer countries  to   manage  their public debt   and  questions as to  whether  the   account of their external liabilities was   accurate and comprehensive.   The  preliminary finding s   of the on going exercise  and gap between   the debtor and creditor figures  may suggest these concerns  are   well - founded.   However, weak   debt management is  only  one of the   reasons for the  discrepanc y   between the data reported by   debtors  to t he DRS  and the comparable   information provided by creditors .  The c hallenges of   aligning  the  datasets  due  to  the  loan/tranche  format  of  reporting    are    discussed  above,   me thodological  inconsistencies     and    some    potential  double - counting     due  to  reporting  of   contingent liabilities   a re  other  key factors.   Some of the   principal issues   regarding the debtor   reports to the DRS and the creditor records are set out below.      Debtor - related  data   issues    ➢   Some  DRS data  is  estimated   not reported by the borrower .   DSSI - eligible  countries  often  strive   to overcome  debt management challenges that translate into limitations on the  capacity to   report viable, timely and comprehensive reports to the DRS .  System fa ilures, f ragility,  natural   disasters,    conflicts     and    crisis  situations  and    exogenous    factors  beyond  their    control    exacerbate these challenges .  In 2021 ,   5   of the se   7 7  IDA - eligible  countries  required to report   to the DRS were unable to meet the  reporting requirement and  countries  such as Syria and   Yemen have not reported for the past  5   years.  In cases of  non - reporting ,   the World Bank debt   team  estimates the DRS data  using other  available  sources of information.     ➢   The d ebtor   may   define  external public debt   more narrowly than  the DRS reporting mandat e.    This is typically  a definition  that includes only borrowing by the central government  and  public   entities that benefits from an explicit  sovereign  guarantee ,   and not the broader  international   definition  of external public debt  used by the DRS and elaborated in  S ection  III .   As such, some   of  State - Owned   Enterprises (SOE s ) external debt liabilities are not reported to the DRS.    ➢   Time lags  in recording  new  commitments   and  loan  disbursements  by national debt offices are   common .  These are reflective of  weak  monitoring procedures  at the national level   and   attributable   to   poor communication, inadequate  human resources ,  delays in entering data   into the debt recording system   and other institutional factors .   These delays have a knock - on   effect on DRS reporting  whi ch may record loan commitments and disbursements a year later   than the creditor record.    ➢   Late interest and penalty interest are rarely reported to the DRS.   Part of the reason for this   lies in lack of understanding of how late and penalty interest is calcula ted, which is often   complex and differs significantly amongst creditors. Limitations in debt management software   which do es   not always  provide   for  the  calculation and recording of interest penalties also   impede reporting.  6       Creditor - related data issues    ➢   Abse nce of a standardized methodology .   Creditors  that  participat e   in the data sharing exercise   all provided information in  accordance with the  agreed  reporting template . However, the data   themselves  are   compiled  in accordance with the national leg islative and  accounting   norms .   These  vary from one creditor to the  other  and   often do not accord to the international   standards and definitions that underpin the DRS ,   thereby  compromising both  intra - creditor   and debtor - creditor comparisons .    ➢   Potential double - countin g   due to the inclusion of contingent liabilities .     Some   creditors    included not only direct bilateral loans   in their reports  but also contingent liabilities . These   include  contingent liabilities  associated with export credit  guarantees   and   financing  of    common funds administered by multilateral institutions   for example the EEC - IDA Special   Account.   A   g uaranteed export credit   is captured in the DRS ,   but  as a direct obligation to the   private  entity that provided the loan .  Similarl y, the EEC - IDA Special Account is   included   in the   DRS  but     as  part  of    the  debtor’s  obligations  to  IDA .  The re     also  appears  to  be    some   overstatement of bilateral debt stocks in cases where a loan is undisbursed or only partially   disbursed but the entire  loan amount is recorded as outstanding .         V. N ext  S teps    The preliminary findings of the report indicate that much more needs to be done to complete the   reconciliation of the end - 2021 data recorded in the DRS with the creditor records. They also   confirm ,   however ,   that  for this work to advance in a meaningful and productive way , it  will require   a much closer interaction with creditors to overcome methodological issues   and   understand   precisel y   how each creditor accounts for their bilateral lending and relat ed debt restructuring and   debt service deferrals so data can be aligned with DRS standards and definitions for purposes  of    comparison.     As next step s ,  the World Bank  will   reach out to each of the participating creditors with the aim of   engaging them in an  open and ongoing dialogue . In doing so ,   it will  draw on the model of working   relations  established  with Japan in 2019 which enabled debtor and creditor data to be aligned   and gaps in the  DRS   records filled.  The   World Bank will also reach out to debtor coun tries with   major data discrepancies to ensure that they will reflect reconciled data  in  their database s   and   debt statistics as needed.     T he World Bank, together with the participating G - 7 and Paris Club creditors, will continue to   advocate the importance of data sharing and  to promote   the exercise  in various fora  to  the    creditors that   have not  yet shared data.  The World Bank  aims to  continu e   data sharing and   reconciliation  work with  support from a wider group of creditors, including those in the G20, with   a view to making regular data sharing and reconciliation an established practice.</td>\n",
              "      <td>The preliminary findings from the G-7 and Paris Club countries' debt data sharing exercise, conducted in collaboration with the World Bank, were aimed at enhancing debt transparency, particularly for the world's poorest countries. The exercise was initiated by Japan as a contribution to promoting greater debt transparency. It served as the first step in reconciling debtor-reported information in the World Bank Debtor Reporting System (DRS) with comparable creditor data.\\n\\nComprehensive and transparent public debt data are essential for informed and sustainable borrowing decisions, pricing sovereign risk, and ensuring government accountability. The World Bank has been at the forefront of promoting debt data transparency by collecting and compiling long-series, cross-country comparable data on external debt through the DRS. The DRS aligns with international standards and definitions, allowing for cross-country comparisons and measuring adherence to global norms.\\n\\nThe World Bank's role extends beyond data collection; it also facilitates knowledge transfer on debt measurement, monitoring, and compilation. Additionally, the Bank coordinates with other institutions involved in financial flow information, such as the IMF, OECD, BIS, Commonwealth Secretariat, UNCTAD, and the Paris Club.\\n\\nCreditors play a crucial role in improving debt data quality and transparency. The G-20 endorsed the principles of information sharing and transparency in their Operational Guidelines for Sustainable Financing. However, the effectiveness of data reconciliation exercises depends on timely and transparent disclosure of detailed loan-specific information by creditors.\\n\\nThe G-20 countries provided information to the World Bank on their bilateral claims to IDA-eligible countries in 2020, allowing for the reconciliation of their claims with DRS data. Japan stood out by providing comprehensive loan-by-loan data and engaging in dialogue with the World Bank to resolve discrepancies. This successful outcome prompted Japan to propose a new series of data sharing exercises among G-7 and Paris Club creditors to reconcile data on bilateral loans reported to the DRS. The exercise aimed to validate the accuracy of external debt data, enhance debt transparency, and strengthen debt strategies and sustainability analyses.\\n\\nEighteen creditor countries, including G-7 countries and 11 Paris Club members, participated in the data sharing exercise. The focus was on public sector debt owed to official bilateral creditors, covering all levels of government, central banks, state-owned enterprises, and public entities. A reporting template formulated by the World Bank facilitated the sharing of detailed loan-by-loan information.\\n\\nThe exercise involved comparing basic loan information and end-2021 debt stocks and transactions reported by creditors with DRS data. Reconciliation of loan numbers posed a challenge due to differing reporting norms between debtors and creditors. Despite this challenge, 80% of loans from G-7 countries and 78% of loans from other Paris Club creditors were successfully reconciled.\\n\\nIn terms of debt stocks, creditors reported a total of $62.9 billion at end-2021, 10% higher than the DRS records. The G-7 countries reported a combined end-2021 debt stock of $55.1 billion, while other Paris Club creditors reported $7.8 billion. These findings highlight the importance of data reconciliation to ensure accurate and comprehensive debt reporting.\\n\\nThe data discrepancies identified in the exercise highlight concerns about the ability of poorer countries to manage their public debt and the accuracy of their external liabilities. Further analysis and follow-up are needed to understand the reasons behind these discrepancies and develop measures to address them.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the preliminary findings from the G-7 and Paris Club countries' debt data sharing exercise demonstrate the importance of debt transparency and the role of creditors in improving data quality. The exercise served as a step towards reconciling debtor and creditor records, enhancing debt transparency, and strengthening debt sustainability analyses. However, further efforts are needed to address data discrepancies and ensure accurate and comprehensive debt reporting for the world's poorest countries.</td>\n",

              "0  Preliminary Findings from th e      G - 7 and Paris Club  Countries  Debt  Data Sharing Exercise    World Bank, April 2023       This report sets out the rationale and preliminary findings of the data sharing  exercise between   G - 7  and the World Bank , which has been extended to  all   Paris Club creditors on a voluntary basis .   The exercise was   initiated by Japan as an important  contribution to  furthering the agenda for   greater debt transparency particularly regard ing  the world’s poorest countries.  T h e current   exercise  is the  first step  in the process of  reconciling information reported   by debto rs   to the World   B ank  Debtor Reporting System (DRS) with  the comparable  creditor   data .   As   a second  step, this   exercise could be institutionalized and extended to other creditors (in particular G20   creditors) in   order to improve data reporting in a permanent way.         I. Th e importance of  better debt data  transparency  and the World Bank’s role      Comprehensive,  accurate  and  transparent  public  debt  data  are  fundamental  to  the   management of public liabilities, and the foundation of informed and sustainable borrowing   decisions.  Knowing  what   is already owed is   essential for policymakers to make informe d   borrowing choices, creditors to appropriately price for sovereign risk, and citizens to hold their   governments accountable.   Critically, the availability of high - quality data is a pre - requisite for the   ability of national governments and the international   community to  make informed debt   sustainability analyses, to  minimize the risk of debt cris i s ,   and to take timely remedial action when   they occur.    T he World Bank has long played a leading role in promoting and delivering on greater debt data   transparency.   It collects and compiles the single verifiable source of long - series, cross - country   comparable data on the external debt of low -   and middle - income countries through the World   Bank Debtor Reporting System (DRS) . The DRS   requires regular (annua l and quarterly) and   detailed (loan - by - loan) information on external public and publicly external debt from all  World   Bank   borrowers. The Bank regards the external debt data it collects  through the DRS  as a global   public good and has disseminate d   comprehen sive information, updated on an annual basis, since   1973.     The  DRS  helps  ensur e   debt data conform to  international definitions and standards .  The   reporting  standards    of  the  DRS    accord  with  the  methodology  and  definitions  of  other   international  systems to which it links ,   i.e., the IMF Balance of Payments (BOP) and International   Investment Position (IIP) ,   and the System of National Accounts (SNA).  Thus, data drawn from the   DRS are  cross - country comparable  and the DRS also provides the  yardstick to   measure borrowers’   adherence to, or deviations from  international standards and definitions.  Th is is key  to ensuring   that  greater  debt transparency brings  more  clarity  and  not confusion from a proliferation of   data  compiled  in accordance with national standards that cannot be readily  compared .  Through 2       the process of managing the DRS and  related public  debt data collection systems , e.g.,  the   Quarterly External Debt Data and Quarterly Public Sector Debt Data, the World Bank has    established  a close and  continuous relationship with compilers in national debt offices ,   which   serves as an enabler  for   significant ‘knowledge transfer’ on how   to  measure, monitor and compile   public debt data. The World Bank  also  coordinates  closely with other institutions that compile   information on financial flows (the IMF, the OECD and BIS) ,   and with the Commonwealth   Secretariat (ComSec) and UNCTAD, the key providers of debt management software to low -   and   middle - income countries , as well a s the Paris Club.       II.  Operationalizing the  G - 20 Guidelines for Sustainable Financing    Creditors    have  the  potential  to  be    game  changers  in  improving  debt  data  quality  and   transparency .   The primary responsibility for  accurate, timely and  transparen t  recording   and   reporting   of public debt   lies with borrowers, but creditors have a   critical   contribution to make in   improving debt data quality and   advancing  the goal of greater debt  transparency.  C omprehensive   and systematic   reconciliation of  debtor   and  creditor  records  is an essential element of good   debt management   and  the  most effective and foolproof way of  validating the accuracy of  debt   data, resolving dis crepancies ,  and closing  data  gap s .   Regular data sharing and reconciliation  is   also  key to ensuring  debt sustainability analyses  drive from a solid account of  existing debt   obligations ,  mi nimiz ing   the risk of  debt reaching  unsustainable  levels , and  enabling debtors and   creditors to  quickly  take  appropriate  remedial action when  debt crises  occur.   However, the  ability   to  c onduct   these all - important  data  reconciliation exercises  is  dependent on  creditors  timely   transparent  disclosure of detailed  loan specific information on their lending activities.      The G - 20 countries endorsed the principles of information sharing and transparency by   creditors in their Operational Guidelines for Sustainable Financing 1   agreed in March 2017.  In   2020 G - 20 countries   provided information to the World Bank on their bilateral claims   to   IDA -  eligible   countries to facilitate an exercise to reconcile their bilateral claims with the data reported   to the DRS and ensure an accurate assessment of the impact of the debt deferral   initiative. The   outcome of this data sharing exercise  was limited , primarily because of the low participation by   creditors and the propensity by creditors that did share information to provide only aggregate   data regarding the claims on debtor  countries and the amo u nt of debt service deferred.   Subsequently, the G20  International Financial Architecture (IFA)   Working Group launched a   voluntary stocktaking exercise of debt data shared with   International Financial Institutions (IIFs).      Japan proved  an important exception and demonstrated the vital role creditors must play  to   meet the  goal of greater debt transparency.   The Japanese authorities provided loan - by - loan  data    for all bilateral claims with comprehensive information on loan terms and transact ions. Equally   importantly, they engaged in an open and ongoing dialogue with the World Bank on all the      1     G - 20  Operational Guidelines for Sustainable Financing -- Diagnostic Tool, November 15, 2019 .  3       discrepancies and anomalies identified between its records and the comparable data individual   borrower s   reported to the DRS. This enabled staff who manag e the DRS to follow - up with national   compilers in a coherent and meaningful way to identify the reason for data discrepancies and the   measures required to resolve them.  As a result,   the DRS data for all IDA - eligible debtor countries   were  fully    reconciled  and  aligned  with  those  of  Japan  and  some  important  gaps  were  filled.   The  reconciliation  exercise  enabled  a  gap  of  $1.1  billion  for  Sudan  and  $226  million  for   Zimbabwe to be closed.    Building on thi s   success ful outcome , Japan proposed G - 7  countrie s  and Paris Club  creditors launch   a new series of data sharing exercises aimed at reconciling data on bilateral loans reported to the   DRS by DSSI - eligible countries with the comparable records of all G - 7 and Paris Club creditors,   beginning with end - 2021 da ta. They also encouraged other bilateral creditors to  participate and   share data on their bilateral lending to DSSI - eligible countries.       III. O bjective and  Key Findings from the G7 and Paris Club Data Sharing Exercise    The core objective of th e   exercise  is   to validate the coverage and accuracy of the external debt   data reported to the DRS and thereby enhance debt transparency and strengthen medium - term   debt strategies and debt sustainability analyses.   The data sharing exercise between G - 7 and   Pa ris Club bilateral creditors with the World Bank aimed at reconciling the debt data reported to   the World Bank DRS by IDA - eligible  countries   with the comparable information in the records of   the participating creditors. This data comparison  and reconciliat ion  is of particular significance  in   the case of  the se  countries .   Despite concerted efforts over the past decade to strengthen debt   management   capacity by national authorities, with support from their international partners,  for   many of them, the capacity  to comprehensively monitor and report on public debt remai ns weak.      Eigh teen   creditor countries participated in the data sharing exercise ,   the G - 7 co untries ( Canada,   France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom ,   and the United States of America) and  1 1   of   the other 15 permanent   Paris Club  member  countrie s   ( Australia,  Brazil,  Denmark,  Finland,  Israel,   Korea,  the Netherlands,  Norway,  Spain ,   Switzerland,  and Sweden ) , among which one member   country  provided a link to an online database, but the information was partial and pertained only   to loan agreements concluded in 2022.    The focus of the data comparison exercise was  on  public sector debt owed to official bilateral   creditors,   defined in accordance with international standards and definitions . The se include  the   sector classification of borrower and creditor   to which all DRS reporting countries adhere.   The   DRS    definition  of  e xternal  public  debt  encompass es     external  borrowing  by  all  levels  of   government and government agencies,  including the central bank, s tate  o wned  e nterprises,   d evelopment banks and other public entities ,  with or without a guarantee from the sovereign   government.  Official  bilateral  credito rs  constitute  sovereign  governments  and  all  public   institutions in which the government share is 50 percent or  more  and   including, as defined by the 4       SNA,   general government, central government ,   state and local government ,   central bank ,   and   public enterpris e.     The data sharing exercise was based on a  r eporting  t emplate  formulated by the World Bank in   consultation with creditors.  The  t emplate  asked for  detailed loan - by - loan information on the   bas ic   loan  information and  terms ,   including  date of the loan agreement,  the  borrower and   creditor entity   as recorded in the loan contract,  the name of  the contract  and currency  in which   financing is extended and/or  repa id ,   and the  loan  repayment terms including the interest rate. It   also asked credi tors to provide  loan - by - loan  information on end - 2021 debt stocks and related   2021 transactions   that include interest paid, principal and interest arrears ,   as well as late interest   paymen ts .   Participating creditors  shared detailed information on each bilateral loan extended to   IDA - eligible countries  in the format requested.     The c omparison of DRS data with the information reported by creditors was a two - fold exercise   that  looked  at  both  basic  loan  information  and  the     end - 2021  transactions.    The  broad   parameters of the comparison and the key findings are set out below.    ➢   Comparison of basic loan information reported by creditors with the DRS database.   The   primary identifier of a loan in the DRS and creditor records is the   loan number. However, the   loan number used by borrowers when reporting a loan to the DRS  is   different from the loan   number used by creditors in their own records. Therefore, each loan  had to be  “m atched ”    using the basi c   loan information (date of commitment, currency, loan terms ,   debt stock at   end - 2021 ,  etc.) for each loan in the  DRS  debtor data set   with the comparable loan information   provided by the creditor.  Creditors reported a total of  3,655   individual  loans of which  3,   358    were loans from G7 countries and  297   loans  from other Paris Club countries.   T h us far ,   80   percent of the loans  from  G - 7 countries  and 78 percent of those from  other participating   Paris Club creditors   have been reconciled with their counterpart in the DRS database.   A   major  challenge  of the reconciliation  exercise  derives from the   practice of some  creditors  to   account for and report  each  loan  tranche (disbursement)  as a  separate  loan   whereas debtors   typically report   one consolidated loan to the DRS .   Identifying the appropriate linkages is both   challenging and time - consuming and  the difference in reporting  norms by debtors and   creditors  is  also the  primary  reason   for why the total number of loans , 2,228   recorded in the   DRS ,   is much lower .     ➢   Comparison of end - 2021 debt stocks and 2021 transactions.   A second loan - by - loan  exercise   compared  the  debt stock position  at end - 2021  reported by debtors to the DRS with the   creditor records.  Creditors reported a total debt stock of $ 62.9  billion at end - 2021,  10   percent higher than the comparable  end - 2021  debt stock of $ 5 6. 4   billion recorded in the   DRS.   The  G - 7 countries  reported a  combined end - 2021 debt  stock of  $55.1   billion ,  10   percent higher than the   comparable   $50  billion recorded in the DRS.  The other participating   Paris Club creditors  reported a  combined end - 2021 debt stock  of  $7.8   billion,  22  percent   higher than the   $6.4  billion  reported to the DRS.  5       IV .   Understanding the  Data Discrepancies between DRS  Debtor  data and Creditor record s    T he  impetus for the data  reconciliation exercise   discussed in this report  was  concerns, widely   expressed by the international community,  about  the ability  of the  world’s  poorer countries  to   manage  their public debt   and  questions as to  whether  the   account of their external liabilities was   accurate and comprehensive.   The  preliminary finding s   of the on going exercise  and gap between   the debtor and creditor figures  may suggest these concerns  are   well - founded.   However, weak   debt management is  only  one of the   reasons for the  discrepanc y   between the data reported by   debtors  to t he DRS  and the comparable   information provided by creditors .  The c hallenges of   aligning  the  datasets  due  to  the  loan/tranche  format  of  reporting    are    discussed  above,   me thodological  inconsistencies     and    some    potential  double - counting     due  to  reporting  of   contingent liabilities   a re  other  key factors.   Some of the   principal issues   regarding the debtor   reports to the DRS and the creditor records are set out below.      Debtor - related  data   issues    ➢   Some  DRS data  is  estimated   not reported by the borrower .   DSSI - eligible  countries  often  strive   to overcome  debt management challenges that translate into limitations on the  capacity to   report viable, timely and comprehensive reports to the DRS .  System fa ilures, f ragility,  natural   disasters,    conflicts     and    crisis  situations  and    exogenous    factors  beyond  their    control    exacerbate these challenges .  In 2021 ,   5   of the se   7 7  IDA - eligible  countries  required to report   to the DRS were unable to meet the  reporting requirement and  countries  such as Syria and   Yemen have not reported for the past  5   years.  In cases of  non - reporting ,   the World Bank debt   team  estimates the DRS data  using other  available  sources of information.     ➢   The d ebtor   may   define  external public debt   more narrowly than  the DRS reporting mandat e.    This is typically  a definition  that includes only borrowing by the central government  and  public   entities that benefits from an explicit  sovereign  guarantee ,   and not the broader  international   definition  of external public debt  used by the DRS and elaborated in  S ection  III .   As such, some   of  State - Owned   Enterprises (SOE s ) external debt liabilities are not reported to the DRS.    ➢   Time lags  in recording  new  commitments   and  loan  disbursements  by national debt offices are   common .  These are reflective of  weak  monitoring procedures  at the national level   and   attributable   to   poor communication, inadequate  human resources ,  delays in entering data   into the debt recording system   and other institutional factors .   These delays have a knock - on   effect on DRS reporting  whi ch may record loan commitments and disbursements a year later   than the creditor record.    ➢   Late interest and penalty interest are rarely reported to the DRS.   Part of the reason for this   lies in lack of understanding of how late and penalty interest is calcula ted, which is often   complex and differs significantly amongst creditors. Limitations in debt management software   which do es   not always  provide   for  the  calculation and recording of interest penalties also   impede reporting.  6       Creditor - related data issues    ➢   Abse nce of a standardized methodology .   Creditors  that  participat e   in the data sharing exercise   all provided information in  accordance with the  agreed  reporting template . However, the data   themselves  are   compiled  in accordance with the national leg islative and  accounting   norms .   These  vary from one creditor to the  other  and   often do not accord to the international   standards and definitions that underpin the DRS ,   thereby  compromising both  intra - creditor   and debtor - creditor comparisons .    ➢   Potential double - countin g   due to the inclusion of contingent liabilities .     Some   creditors    included not only direct bilateral loans   in their reports  but also contingent liabilities . These   include  contingent liabilities  associated with export credit  guarantees   and   financing  of    common funds administered by multilateral institutions   for example the EEC - IDA Special   Account.   A   g uaranteed export credit   is captured in the DRS ,   but  as a direct obligation to the   private  entity that provided the loan .  Similarl y, the EEC - IDA Special Account is   included   in the   DRS  but     as  part  of    the  debtor’s  obligations  to  IDA .  The re     also  appears  to  be    some   overstatement of bilateral debt stocks in cases where a loan is undisbursed or only partially   disbursed but the entire  loan amount is recorded as outstanding .         V. N ext  S teps    The preliminary findings of the report indicate that much more needs to be done to complete the   reconciliation of the end - 2021 data recorded in the DRS with the creditor records. They also   confirm ,   however ,   that  for this work to advance in a meaningful and productive way , it  will require   a much closer interaction with creditors to overcome methodological issues   and   understand   precisel y   how each creditor accounts for their bilateral lending and relat ed debt restructuring and   debt service deferrals so data can be aligned with DRS standards and definitions for purposes  of    comparison.     As next step s ,  the World Bank  will   reach out to each of the participating creditors with the aim of   engaging them in an  open and ongoing dialogue . In doing so ,   it will  draw on the model of working   relations  established  with Japan in 2019 which enabled debtor and creditor data to be aligned   and gaps in the  DRS   records filled.  The   World Bank will also reach out to debtor coun tries with   major data discrepancies to ensure that they will reflect reconciled data  in  their database s   and   debt statistics as needed.     T he World Bank, together with the participating G - 7 and Paris Club creditors, will continue to   advocate the importance of data sharing and  to promote   the exercise  in various fora  to  the    creditors that   have not  yet shared data.

              "0   The preliminary findings from the G-7 and Paris Club countries' debt data sharing exercise, conducted in collaboration with the World Bank, were aimed at enhancing debt transparency, particularly for the world's poorest countries. The exercise was initiated by Japan as a contribution to promoting greater debt transparency. It served as the first step in reconciling debtor-reported information in the World Bank Debtor Reporting System (DRS) with comparable creditor data.\\n\\nComprehensive and transparent public debt data are essential for informed and sustainable borrowing decisions, pricing sovereign risk, and ensuring government accountability. The World Bank has been at the forefront of promoting debt data transparency by collecting and compiling long-series, cross-country comparable data on external debt through the DRS. The DRS aligns with international standards and definitions, allowing for cross-country comparisons and measuring adherence to global norms.\\n\\nThe World Bank's role extends beyond data collection; it also facilitates knowledge transfer on debt measurement, monitoring, and compilation. Additionally, the Bank coordinates with other institutions involved in financial flow information, such as the IMF, OECD, BIS, Commonwealth Secretariat, UNCTAD, and the Paris Club.\\n\\nCreditors play a crucial role in improving debt data quality and transparency. The G-20 endorsed the principles of information sharing and transparency in their Operational Guidelines for Sustainable Financing. However, the effectiveness of data reconciliation exercises depends on timely and transparent disclosure of detailed loan-specific information by creditors.\\n\\nThe G-20 countries provided information to the World Bank on their bilateral claims to IDA-eligible countries in 2020, allowing for the reconciliation of their claims with DRS data. Japan stood out by providing comprehensive loan-by-loan data and engaging in dialogue with the World Bank to resolve discrepancies. This successful outcome prompted Japan to propose a new series of data sharing exercises among G-7 and Paris Club creditors to reconcile data on bilateral loans reported to the DRS. The exercise aimed to validate the accuracy of external debt data, enhance debt transparency, and strengthen debt strategies and sustainability analyses.\\n\\nEighteen creditor countries, including G-7 countries and 11 Paris Club members, participated in the data sharing exercise. The focus was on public sector debt owed to official bilateral creditors, covering all levels of government, central banks, state-owned enterprises, and public entities. A reporting template formulated by the World Bank facilitated the sharing of detailed loan-by-loan information.\\n\\nThe exercise involved comparing basic loan information and end-2021 debt stocks and transactions reported by creditors with DRS data. Reconciliation of loan numbers posed a challenge due to differing reporting norms between debtors and creditors. Despite this challenge, 80% of loans from G-7 countries and 78% of loans from other Paris Club creditors were successfully reconciled.\\n\\nIn terms of debt stocks, creditors reported a total of $62.9 billion at end-2021, 10% higher than the DRS records. The G-7 countries reported a combined end-2021 debt stock of $55.1 billion, while other Paris Club creditors reported $7.8 billion. These findings highlight the importance of data reconciliation to ensure accurate and comprehensive debt reporting.\\n\\nThe data discrepancies identified in the exercise highlight concerns about the ability of poorer countries to manage their public debt and the accuracy of their external liabilities. Further analysis and follow-up are needed to understand the reasons behind these discrepancies and develop measures to address them.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the preliminary findings from the G-7 and Paris Club countries' debt data sharing exercise demonstrate the importance of debt transparency and the role of creditors in improving data quality. The exercise served as a step towards reconciling debtor and creditor records, enhancing debt transparency, and strengthening debt sustainability analyses. However, further efforts are needed to address data discrepancies and ensure accurate and comprehensive debt reporting for the world's poorest countries.  "

              "      <td>Preliminary Findings from th e      G - 7 and Paris Club  Countries  Debt  Data Sharing Exercise    World Bank, April 2023       This report sets out the rationale and preliminary findings of the data sharing  exercise between   G - 7  and the World Bank , which has been extended to  all   Paris Club creditors on a voluntary basis .   The exercise was   initiated by Japan as an important  contribution to  furthering the agenda for   greater debt transparency particularly regard ing  the world’s poorest countries.  T h e current   exercise  is the  first step  in the process of  reconciling information reported   by debto rs   to the World   B ank  Debtor Reporting System (DRS) with  the comparable  creditor   data .   As   a second  step, this   exercise could be institutionalized and extended to other creditors (in particular G20   creditors) in   order to improve data reporting in a permanent way.         I. Th e importance of  better debt data  transparency  and the World Bank’s role      Comprehensive,  accurate  and  transparent  public  debt  data  are  fundamental  to  the   management of public liabilities, and the foundation of informed and sustainable borrowing   decisions.  Knowing  what   is already owed is   essential for policymakers to make informe d   borrowing choices, creditors to appropriately price for sovereign risk, and citizens to hold their   governments accountable.   Critically, the availability of high - quality data is a pre - requisite for the   ability of national governments and the international   community to  make informed debt   sustainability analyses, to  minimize the risk of debt cris i s ,   and to take timely remedial action when   they occur.    T he World Bank has long played a leading role in promoting and delivering on greater debt data   transparency.   It collects and compiles the single verifiable source of long - series, cross - country   comparable data on the external debt of low -   and middle - income countries through the World   Bank Debtor Reporting System (DRS) . The DRS   requires regular (annua l and quarterly) and   detailed (loan - by - loan) information on external public and publicly external debt from all  World   Bank   borrowers. The Bank regards the external debt data it collects  through the DRS  as a global   public good and has disseminate d   comprehen sive information, updated on an annual basis, since   1973.     The  DRS  helps  ensur e   debt data conform to  international definitions and standards .  The   reporting  standards    of  the  DRS    accord  with  the  methodology  and  definitions  of  other   international  systems to which it links ,   i.e., the IMF Balance of Payments (BOP) and International   Investment Position (IIP) ,   and the System of National Accounts (SNA).  Thus, data drawn from the   DRS are  cross - country comparable  and the DRS also provides the  yardstick to   measure borrowers’   adherence to, or deviations from  international standards and definitions.  Th is is key  to ensuring   that  greater  debt transparency brings  more  clarity  and  not confusion from a proliferation of   data  compiled  in accordance with national standards that cannot be readily  compared .  Through 2       the process of managing the DRS and  related public  debt data collection systems , e.g.,  the   Quarterly External Debt Data and Quarterly Public Sector Debt Data, the World Bank has    established  a close and  continuous relationship with compilers in national debt offices ,   which   serves as an enabler  for   significant ‘knowledge transfer’ on how   to  measure, monitor and compile   public debt data. The World Bank  also  coordinates  closely with other institutions that compile   information on financial flows (the IMF, the OECD and BIS) ,   and with the Commonwealth   Secretariat (ComSec) and UNCTAD, the key providers of debt management software to low -   and   middle - income countries , as well a s the Paris Club.       II.  Operationalizing the  G - 20 Guidelines for Sustainable Financing    Creditors    have  the  potential  to  be    game  changers  in  improving  debt  data  quality  and   transparency .   The primary responsibility for  accurate, timely and  transparen t  recording   and   reporting   of public debt   lies with borrowers, but creditors have a   critical   contribution to make in   improving debt data quality and   advancing  the goal of greater debt  transparency.  C omprehensive   and systematic   reconciliation of  debtor   and  creditor  records  is an essential element of good   debt management   and  the  most effective and foolproof way of  validating the accuracy of  debt   data, resolving dis crepancies ,  and closing  data  gap s .   Regular data sharing and reconciliation  is   also  key to ensuring  debt sustainability analyses  drive from a solid account of  existing debt   obligations ,  mi nimiz ing   the risk of  debt reaching  unsustainable  levels , and  enabling debtors and   creditors to  quickly  take  appropriate  remedial action when  debt crises  occur.   However, the  ability   to  c onduct   these all - important  data  reconciliation exercises  is  dependent on  creditors  timely   transparent  disclosure of detailed  loan specific information on their lending activities.      The G - 20 countries endorsed the principles of information sharing and transparency by   creditors in their Operational Guidelines for Sustainable Financing 1   agreed in March 2017.  In   2020 G - 20 countries   provided information to the World Bank on their bilateral claims   to   IDA -  eligible   countries to facilitate an exercise to reconcile their bilateral claims with the data reported   to the DRS and ensure an accurate assessment of the impact of the debt deferral   initiative. The   outcome of this data sharing exercise  was limited , primarily because of the low participation by   creditors and the propensity by creditors that did share information to provide only aggregate   data regarding the claims on debtor  countries and the amo u nt of debt service deferred.   Subsequently, the G20  International Financial Architecture (IFA)   Working Group launched a   voluntary stocktaking exercise of debt data shared with   International Financial Institutions (IIFs).      Japan proved  an important exception and demonstrated the vital role creditors must play  to   meet the  goal of greater debt transparency.   The Japanese authorities provided loan - by - loan  data    for all bilateral claims with comprehensive information on loan terms and transact ions. Equally   importantly, they engaged in an open and ongoing dialogue with the World Bank on all the      1     G - 20  Operational Guidelines for Sustainable Financing -- Diagnostic Tool, November 15, 2019 .  3       discrepancies and anomalies identified between its records and the comparable data individual   borrower s   reported to the DRS. This enabled staff who manag e the DRS to follow - up with national   compilers in a coherent and meaningful way to identify the reason for data discrepancies and the   measures required to resolve them.  As a result,   the DRS data for all IDA - eligible debtor countries   were  fully    reconciled  and  aligned  with  those  of  Japan  and  some  important  gaps  were  filled.   The  reconciliation  exercise  enabled  a  gap  of  $1.1  billion  for  Sudan  and  $226  million  for   Zimbabwe to be closed.    Building on thi s   success ful outcome , Japan proposed G - 7  countrie s  and Paris Club  creditors launch   a new series of data sharing exercises aimed at reconciling data on bilateral loans reported to the   DRS by DSSI - eligible countries with the comparable records of all G - 7 and Paris Club creditors,   beginning with end - 2021 da ta. They also encouraged other bilateral creditors to  participate and   share data on their bilateral lending to DSSI - eligible countries.       III. O bjective and  Key Findings from the G7 and Paris Club Data Sharing Exercise    The core objective of th e   exercise  is   to validate the coverage and accuracy of the external debt   data reported to the DRS and thereby enhance debt transparency and strengthen medium - term   debt strategies and debt sustainability analyses.   The data sharing exercise between G - 7 and   Pa ris Club bilateral creditors with the World Bank aimed at reconciling the debt data reported to   the World Bank DRS by IDA - eligible  countries   with the comparable information in the records of   the participating creditors. This data comparison  and reconciliat ion  is of particular significance  in   the case of  the se  countries .   Despite concerted efforts over the past decade to strengthen debt   management   capacity by national authorities, with support from their international partners,  for   many of them, the capacity  to comprehensively monitor and report on public debt remai ns weak.      Eigh teen   creditor countries participated in the data sharing exercise ,   the G - 7 co untries ( Canada,   France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom ,   and the United States of America) and  1 1   of   the other 15 permanent   Paris Club  member  countrie s   ( Australia,  Brazil,  Denmark,  Finland,  Israel,   Korea,  the Netherlands,  Norway,  Spain ,   Switzerland,  and Sweden ) , among which one member   country  provided a link to an online database, but the information was partial and pertained only   to loan agreements concluded in 2022.    The focus of the data comparison exercise was  on  public sector debt owed to official bilateral   creditors,   defined in accordance with international standards and definitions . The se include  the   sector classification of borrower and creditor   to which all DRS reporting countries adhere.   The   DRS    definition  of  e xternal  public  debt  encompass es     external  borrowing  by  all  levels  of   government and government agencies,  including the central bank, s tate  o wned  e nterprises,   d evelopment banks and other public entities ,  with or without a guarantee from the sovereign   government.  Official  bilateral  credito rs  constitute  sovereign  governments  and  all  public   institutions in which the government share is 50 percent or  more  and   including, as defined by the 4       SNA,   general government, central government ,   state and local government ,   central bank ,   and   public enterpris e.     The data sharing exercise was based on a  r eporting  t emplate  formulated by the World Bank in   consultation with creditors.  The  t emplate  asked for  detailed loan - by - loan information on the   bas ic   loan  information and  terms ,   including  date of the loan agreement,  the  borrower and   creditor entity   as recorded in the loan contract,  the name of  the contract  and currency  in which   financing is extended and/or  repa id ,   and the  loan  repayment terms including the interest rate. It   also asked credi tors to provide  loan - by - loan  information on end - 2021 debt stocks and related   2021 transactions   that include interest paid, principal and interest arrears ,   as well as late interest   paymen ts .   Participating creditors  shared detailed information on each bilateral loan extended to   IDA - eligible countries  in the format requested.     The c omparison of DRS data with the information reported by creditors was a two - fold exercise   that  looked  at  both  basic  loan  information  and  the     end - 2021  transactions.    The  broad   parameters of the comparison and the key findings are set out below.    ➢   Comparison of basic loan information reported by creditors with the DRS database.   The   primary identifier of a loan in the DRS and creditor records is the   loan number. However, the   loan number used by borrowers when reporting a loan to the DRS  is   different from the loan   number used by creditors in their own records. Therefore, each loan  had to be  “m atched ”    using the basi c   loan information (date of commitment, currency, loan terms ,   debt stock at   end - 2021 ,  etc.) for each loan in the  DRS  debtor data set   with the comparable loan information   provided by the creditor.  Creditors reported a total of  3,655   individual  loans of which  3,   358    were loans from G7 countries and  297   loans  from other Paris Club countries.   T h us far ,   80   percent of the loans  from  G - 7 countries  and 78 percent of those from  other participating   Paris Club creditors   have been reconciled with their counterpart in the DRS database.   A   major  challenge  of the reconciliation  exercise  derives from the   practice of some  creditors  to   account for and report  each  loan  tranche (disbursement)  as a  separate  loan   whereas debtors   typically report   one consolidated loan to the DRS .   Identifying the appropriate linkages is both   challenging and time - consuming and  the difference in reporting  norms by debtors and   creditors  is  also the  primary  reason   for why the total number of loans , 2,228   recorded in the   DRS ,   is much lower .     ➢   Comparison of end - 2021 debt stocks and 2021 transactions.   A second loan - by - loan  exercise   compared  the  debt stock position  at end - 2021  reported by debtors to the DRS with the   creditor records.  Creditors reported a total debt stock of $ 62.9  billion at end - 2021,  10   percent higher than the comparable  end - 2021  debt stock of $ 5 6. 4   billion recorded in the   DRS.   The  G - 7 countries  reported a  combined end - 2021 debt  stock of  $55.1   billion ,  10   percent higher than the   comparable   $50  billion recorded in the DRS.  The other participating   Paris Club creditors  reported a  combined end - 2021 debt stock  of  $7.8   billion,  22  percent   higher than the   $6.4  billion  reported to the DRS.  5       IV .   Understanding the  Data Discrepancies between DRS  Debtor  data and Creditor record s    T he  impetus for the data  reconciliation exercise   discussed in this report  was  concerns, widely   expressed by the international community,  about  the ability  of the  world’s  poorer countries  to   manage  their public debt   and  questions as to  whether  the   account of their external liabilities was   accurate and comprehensive.   The  preliminary finding s   of the on going exercise  and gap between   the debtor and creditor figures  may suggest these concerns  are   well - founded.   However, weak   debt management is  only  one of the   reasons for the  discrepanc y   between the data reported by   debtors  to t he DRS  and the comparable   information provided by creditors .  The c hallenges of   aligning  the  datasets  due  to  the  loan/tranche  format  of  reporting    are    discussed  above,   me thodological  inconsistencies     and    some    potential  double - counting     due  to  reporting  of   contingent liabilities   a re  other  key factors.   Some of the   principal issues   regarding the debtor   reports to the DRS and the creditor records are set out below.      Debtor - related  data   issues    ➢   Some  DRS data  is  estimated   not reported by the borrower .   DSSI - eligible  countries  often  strive   to overcome  debt management challenges that translate into limitations on the  capacity to   report viable, timely and comprehensive reports to the DRS .  System fa ilures, f ragility,  natural   disasters,    conflicts     and    crisis  situations  and    exogenous    factors  beyond  their    control    exacerbate these challenges .  In 2021 ,   5   of the se   7 7  IDA - eligible  countries  required to report   to the DRS were unable to meet the  reporting requirement and  countries  such as Syria and   Yemen have not reported for the past  5   years.  In cases of  non - reporting ,   the World Bank debt   team  estimates the DRS data  using other  available  sources of information.     ➢   The d ebtor   may   define  external public debt   more narrowly than  the DRS reporting mandat e.    This is typically  a definition  that includes only borrowing by the central government  and  public   entities that benefits from an explicit  sovereign  guarantee ,   and not the broader  international   definition  of external public debt  used by the DRS and elaborated in  S ection  III .   As such, some   of  State - Owned   Enterprises (SOE s ) external debt liabilities are not reported to the DRS.    ➢   Time lags  in recording  new  commitments   and  loan  disbursements  by national debt offices are   common .  These are reflective of  weak  monitoring procedures  at the national level   and   attributable   to   poor communication, inadequate  human resources ,  delays in entering data   into the debt recording system   and other institutional factors .   These delays have a knock - on   effect on DRS reporting  whi ch may record loan commitments and disbursements a year later   than the creditor record.    ➢   Late interest and penalty interest are rarely reported to the DRS.   Part of the reason for this   lies in lack of understanding of how late and penalty interest is calcula ted, which is often   complex and differs significantly amongst creditors. Limitations in debt management software   which do es   not always  provide   for  the  calculation and recording of interest penalties also   impede reporting.  6       Creditor - related data issues    ➢   Abse nce of a standardized methodology .   Creditors  that  participat e   in the data sharing exercise   all provided information in  accordance with the  agreed  reporting template . However, the data   themselves  are   compiled  in accordance with the national leg islative and  accounting   norms .   These  vary from one creditor to the  other  and   often do not accord to the international   standards and definitions that underpin the DRS ,   thereby  compromising both  intra - creditor   and debtor - creditor comparisons .    ➢   Potential double - countin g   due to the inclusion of contingent liabilities .     Some   creditors    included not only direct bilateral loans   in their reports  but also contingent liabilities . These   include  contingent liabilities  associated with export credit  guarantees   and   financing  of    common funds administered by multilateral institutions   for example the EEC - IDA Special   Account.   A   g uaranteed export credit   is captured in the DRS ,   but  as a direct obligation to the   private  entity that provided the loan .  Similarl y, the EEC - IDA Special Account is   included   in the   DRS  but     as  part  of    the  debtor’s  obligations  to  IDA .  The re     also  appears  to  be    some   overstatement of bilateral debt stocks in cases where a loan is undisbursed or only partially   disbursed but the entire  loan amount is recorded as outstanding .         V. N ext  S teps    The preliminary findings of the report indicate that much more needs to be done to complete the   reconciliation of the end - 2021 data recorded in the DRS with the creditor records. They also   confirm ,   however ,   that  for this work to advance in a meaningful and productive way , it  will require   a much closer interaction with creditors to overcome methodological issues   and   understand   precisel y   how each creditor accounts for their bilateral lending and relat ed debt restructuring and   debt service deferrals so data can be aligned with DRS standards and definitions for purposes  of    comparison.     As next step s ,  the World Bank  will   reach out to each of the participating creditors with the aim of   engaging them in an  open and ongoing dialogue . In doing so ,   it will  draw on the model of working   relations  established  with Japan in 2019 which enabled debtor and creditor data to be aligned   and gaps in the  DRS   records filled.  The   World Bank will also reach out to debtor coun tries with   major data discrepancies to ensure that they will reflect reconciled data  in  their database s   and   debt statistics as needed.     T he World Bank, together with the participating G - 7 and Paris Club creditors, will continue to   advocate the importance of data sharing and  to promote   the exercise  in various fora  to  the    creditors that   have not  yet shared data.  The World Bank  aims to  continu e   data sharing and   reconciliation  work with  support from a wider group of creditors, including those in the G20, with   a view to making regular data sharing and reconciliation an established practice.</td>\n",
              "      <td>The preliminary findings from the G-7 and Paris Club countries' debt data sharing exercise, conducted in collaboration with the World Bank, were aimed at enhancing debt transparency, particularly for the world's poorest countries. The exercise was initiated by Japan as a contribution to promoting greater debt transparency. It served as the first step in reconciling debtor-reported information in the World Bank Debtor Reporting System (DRS) with comparable creditor data.\\n\\nComprehensive and transparent public debt data are essential for informed and sustainable borrowing decisions, pricing sovereign risk, and ensuring government accountability. The World Bank has been at the forefront of promoting debt data transparency by collecting and compiling long-series, cross-country comparable data on external debt through the DRS. The DRS aligns with international standards and definitions, allowing for cross-country comparisons and measuring adherence to global norms.\\n\\nThe World Bank's role extends beyond data collection; it also facilitates knowledge transfer on debt measurement, monitoring, and compilation. Additionally, the Bank coordinates with other institutions involved in financial flow information, such as the IMF, OECD, BIS, Commonwealth Secretariat, UNCTAD, and the Paris Club.\\n\\nCreditors play a crucial role in improving debt data quality and transparency. The G-20 endorsed the principles of information sharing and transparency in their Operational Guidelines for Sustainable Financing. However, the effectiveness of data reconciliation exercises depends on timely and transparent disclosure of detailed loan-specific information by creditors.\\n\\nThe G-20 countries provided information to the World Bank on their bilateral claims to IDA-eligible countries in 2020, allowing for the reconciliation of their claims with DRS data. Japan stood out by providing comprehensive loan-by-loan data and engaging in dialogue with the World Bank to resolve discrepancies. This successful outcome prompted Japan to propose a new series of data sharing exercises among G-7 and Paris Club creditors to reconcile data on bilateral loans reported to the DRS. The exercise aimed to validate the accuracy of external debt data, enhance debt transparency, and strengthen debt strategies and sustainability analyses.\\n\\nEighteen creditor countries, including G-7 countries and 11 Paris Club members, participated in the data sharing exercise. The focus was on public sector debt owed to official bilateral creditors, covering all levels of government, central banks, state-owned enterprises, and public entities. A reporting template formulated by the World Bank facilitated the sharing of detailed loan-by-loan information.\\n\\nThe exercise involved comparing basic loan information and end-2021 debt stocks and transactions reported by creditors with DRS data. Reconciliation of loan numbers posed a challenge due to differing reporting norms between debtors and creditors. Despite this challenge, 80% of loans from G-7 countries and 78% of loans from other Paris Club creditors were successfully reconciled.\\n\\nIn terms of debt stocks, creditors reported a total of $62.9 billion at end-2021, 10% higher than the DRS records. The G-7 countries reported a combined end-2021 debt stock of $55.1 billion, while other Paris Club creditors reported $7.8 billion. These findings highlight the importance of data reconciliation to ensure accurate and comprehensive debt reporting.\\n\\nThe data discrepancies identified in the exercise highlight concerns about the ability of poorer countries to manage their public debt and the accuracy of their external liabilities. Further analysis and follow-up are needed to understand the reasons behind these discrepancies and develop measures to address them.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the preliminary findings from the G-7 and Paris Club countries' debt data sharing exercise demonstrate the importance of debt transparency and the role of creditors in improving data quality. The exercise served as a step towards reconciling debtor and creditor records, enhancing debt transparency, and strengthening debt sustainability analyses. However, further efforts are needed to address data discrepancies and ensure accurate and comprehensive debt reporting for the world's poorest countries.</td>\n",

              "0  Preliminary Findings from th e      G - 7 and Paris Club  Countries  Debt  Data Sharing Exercise    World Bank, April 2023       This report sets out the rationale and preliminary findings of the data sharing  exercise between   G - 7  and the World Bank , which has been extended to  all   Paris Club creditors on a voluntary basis .   The exercise was   initiated by Japan as an important  contribution to  furthering the agenda for   greater debt transparency particularly regard ing  the world’s poorest countries.  T h e current   exercise  is the  first step  in the process of  reconciling information reported   by debto rs   to the World   B ank  Debtor Reporting System (DRS) with  the comparable  creditor   data .   As   a second  step, this   exercise could be institutionalized and extended to other creditors (in particular G20   creditors) in   order to improve data reporting in a permanent way.         I. Th e importance of  better debt data  transparency  and the World Bank’s role      Comprehensive,  accurate  and  transparent  public  debt  data  are  fundamental  to  the   management of public liabilities, and the foundation of informed and sustainable borrowing   decisions.  Knowing  what   is already owed is   essential for policymakers to make informe d   borrowing choices, creditors to appropriately price for sovereign risk, and citizens to hold their   governments accountable.   Critically, the availability of high - quality data is a pre - requisite for the   ability of national governments and the international   community to  make informed debt   sustainability analyses, to  minimize the risk of debt cris i s ,   and to take timely remedial action when   they occur.    T he World Bank has long played a leading role in promoting and delivering on greater debt data   transparency.   It collects and compiles the single verifiable source of long - series, cross - country   comparable data on the external debt of low -   and middle - income countries through the World   Bank Debtor Reporting System (DRS) . The DRS   requires regular (annua l and quarterly) and   detailed (loan - by - loan) information on external public and publicly external debt from all  World   Bank   borrowers. The Bank regards the external debt data it collects  through the DRS  as a global   public good and has disseminate d   comprehen sive information, updated on an annual basis, since   1973.     The  DRS  helps  ensur e   debt data conform to  international definitions and standards .  The   reporting  standards    of  the  DRS    accord  with  the  methodology  and  definitions  of  other   international  systems to which it links ,   i.e., the IMF Balance of Payments (BOP) and International   Investment Position (IIP) ,   and the System of National Accounts (SNA).  Thus, data drawn from the   DRS are  cross - country comparable  and the DRS also provides the  yardstick to   measure borrowers’   adherence to, or deviations from  international standards and definitions.  Th is is key  to ensuring   that  greater  debt transparency brings  more  clarity  and  not confusion from a proliferation of   data  compiled  in accordance with national standards that cannot be readily  compared .  Through 2       the process of managing the DRS and  related public  debt data collection systems , e.g.,  the   Quarterly External Debt Data and Quarterly Public Sector Debt Data, the World Bank has    established  a close and  continuous relationship with compilers in national debt offices ,   which   serves as an enabler  for   significant ‘knowledge transfer’ on how   to  measure, monitor and compile   public debt data. The World Bank  also  coordinates  closely with other institutions that compile   information on financial flows (the IMF, the OECD and BIS) ,   and with the Commonwealth   Secretariat (ComSec) and UNCTAD, the key providers of debt management software to low -   and   middle - income countries , as well a s the Paris Club.       II.  Operationalizing the  G - 20 Guidelines for Sustainable Financing    Creditors    have  the  potential  to  be    game  changers  in  improving  debt  data  quality  and   transparency .   The primary responsibility for  accurate, timely and  transparen t  recording   and   reporting   of public debt   lies with borrowers, but creditors have a   critical   contribution to make in   improving debt data quality and   advancing  the goal of greater debt  transparency.  C omprehensive   and systematic   reconciliation of  debtor   and  creditor  records  is an essential element of good   debt management   and  the  most effective and foolproof way of  validating the accuracy of  debt   data, resolving dis crepancies ,  and closing  data  gap s .   Regular data sharing and reconciliation  is   also  key to ensuring  debt sustainability analyses  drive from a solid account of  existing debt   obligations ,  mi nimiz ing   the risk of  debt reaching  unsustainable  levels , and  enabling debtors and   creditors to  quickly  take  appropriate  remedial action when  debt crises  occur.   However, the  ability   to  c onduct   these all - important  data  reconciliation exercises  is  dependent on  creditors  timely   transparent  disclosure of detailed  loan specific information on their lending activities.      The G - 20 countries endorsed the principles of information sharing and transparency by   creditors in their Operational Guidelines for Sustainable Financing 1   agreed in March 2017.  In   2020 G - 20 countries   provided information to the World Bank on their bilateral claims   to   IDA -  eligible   countries to facilitate an exercise to reconcile their bilateral claims with the data reported   to the DRS and ensure an accurate assessment of the impact of the debt deferral   initiative. The   outcome of this data sharing exercise  was limited , primarily because of the low participation by   creditors and the propensity by creditors that did share information to provide only aggregate   data regarding the claims on debtor  countries and the amo u nt of debt service deferred.   Subsequently, the G20  International Financial Architecture (IFA)   Working Group launched a   voluntary stocktaking exercise of debt data shared with   International Financial Institutions (IIFs).      Japan proved  an important exception and demonstrated the vital role creditors must play  to   meet the  goal of greater debt transparency.   The Japanese authorities provided loan - by - loan  data    for all bilateral claims with comprehensive information on loan terms and transact ions. Equally   importantly, they engaged in an open and ongoing dialogue with the World Bank on all the      1     G - 20  Operational Guidelines for Sustainable Financing -- Diagnostic Tool, November 15, 2019 .  3       discrepancies and anomalies identified between its records and the comparable data individual   borrower s   reported to the DRS. This enabled staff who manag e the DRS to follow - up with national   compilers in a coherent and meaningful way to identify the reason for data discrepancies and the   measures required to resolve them.  As a result,   the DRS data for all IDA - eligible debtor countries   were  fully    reconciled  and  aligned  with  those  of  Japan  and  some  important  gaps  were  filled.   The  reconciliation  exercise  enabled  a  gap  of  $1.1  billion  for  Sudan  and  $226  million  for   Zimbabwe to be closed.    Building on thi s   success ful outcome , Japan proposed G - 7  countrie s  and Paris Club  creditors launch   a new series of data sharing exercises aimed at reconciling data on bilateral loans reported to the   DRS by DSSI - eligible countries with the comparable records of all G - 7 and Paris Club creditors,   beginning with end - 2021 da ta. They also encouraged other bilateral creditors to  participate and   share data on their bilateral lending to DSSI - eligible countries.       III. O bjective and  Key Findings from the G7 and Paris Club Data Sharing Exercise    The core objective of th e   exercise  is   to validate the coverage and accuracy of the external debt   data reported to the DRS and thereby enhance debt transparency and strengthen medium - term   debt strategies and debt sustainability analyses.   The data sharing exercise between G - 7 and   Pa ris Club bilateral creditors with the World Bank aimed at reconciling the debt data reported to   the World Bank DRS by IDA - eligible  countries   with the comparable information in the records of   the participating creditors. This data comparison  and reconciliat ion  is of particular significance  in   the case of  the se  countries .   Despite concerted efforts over the past decade to strengthen debt   management   capacity by national authorities, with support from their international partners,  for   many of them, the capacity  to comprehensively monitor and report on public debt remai ns weak.      Eigh teen   creditor countries participated in the data sharing exercise ,   the G - 7 co untries ( Canada,   France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom ,   and the United States of America) and  1 1   of   the other 15 permanent   Paris Club  member  countrie s   ( Australia,  Brazil,  Denmark,  Finland,  Israel,   Korea,  the Netherlands,  Norway,  Spain ,   Switzerland,  and Sweden ) , among which one member   country  provided a link to an online database, but the information was partial and pertained only   to loan agreements concluded in 2022.    The focus of the data comparison exercise was  on  public sector debt owed to official bilateral   creditors,   defined in accordance with international standards and definitions . The se include  the   sector classification of borrower and creditor   to which all DRS reporting countries adhere.   The   DRS    definition  of  e xternal  public  debt  encompass es     external  borrowing  by  all  levels  of   government and government agencies,  including the central bank, s tate  o wned  e nterprises,   d evelopment banks and other public entities ,  with or without a guarantee from the sovereign   government.  Official  bilateral  credito rs  constitute  sovereign  governments  and  all  public   institutions in which the government share is 50 percent or  more  and   including, as defined by the 4       SNA,   general government, central government ,   state and local government ,   central bank ,   and   public enterpris e.     The data sharing exercise was based on a  r eporting  t emplate  formulated by the World Bank in   consultation with creditors.  The  t emplate  asked for  detailed loan - by - loan information on the   bas ic   loan  information and  terms ,   including  date of the loan agreement,  the  borrower and   creditor entity   as recorded in the loan contract,  the name of  the contract  and currency  in which   financing is extended and/or  repa id ,   and the  loan  repayment terms including the interest rate. It   also asked credi tors to provide  loan - by - loan  information on end - 2021 debt stocks and related   2021 transactions   that include interest paid, principal and interest arrears ,   as well as late interest   paymen ts .   Participating creditors  shared detailed information on each bilateral loan extended to   IDA - eligible countries  in the format requested.     The c omparison of DRS data with the information reported by creditors was a two - fold exercise   that  looked  at  both  basic  loan  information  and  the     end - 2021  transactions.    The  broad   parameters of the comparison and the key findings are set out below.    ➢   Comparison of basic loan information reported by creditors with the DRS database.   The   primary identifier of a loan in the DRS and creditor records is the   loan number. However, the   loan number used by borrowers when reporting a loan to the DRS  is   different from the loan   number used by creditors in their own records. Therefore, each loan  had to be  “m atched ”    using the basi c   loan information (date of commitment, currency, loan terms ,   debt stock at   end - 2021 ,  etc.) for each loan in the  DRS  debtor data set   with the comparable loan information   provided by the creditor.  Creditors reported a total of  3,655   individual  loans of which  3,   358    were loans from G7 countries and  297   loans  from other Paris Club countries.   T h us far ,   80   percent of the loans  from  G - 7 countries  and 78 percent of those from  other participating   Paris Club creditors   have been reconciled with their counterpart in the DRS database.   A   major  challenge  of the reconciliation  exercise  derives from the   practice of some  creditors  to   account for and report  each  loan  tranche (disbursement)  as a  separate  loan   whereas debtors   typically report   one consolidated loan to the DRS .   Identifying the appropriate linkages is both   challenging and time - consuming and  the difference in reporting  norms by debtors and   creditors  is  also the  primary  reason   for why the total number of loans , 2,228   recorded in the   DRS ,   is much lower .     ➢   Comparison of end - 2021 debt stocks and 2021 transactions.   A second loan - by - loan  exercise   compared  the  debt stock position  at end - 2021  reported by debtors to the DRS with the   creditor records.  Creditors reported a total debt stock of $ 62.9  billion at end - 2021,  10   percent higher than the comparable  end - 2021  debt stock of $ 5 6. 4   billion recorded in the   DRS.   The  G - 7 countries  reported a  combined end - 2021 debt  stock of  $55.1   billion ,  10   percent higher than the   comparable   $50  billion recorded in the DRS.  The other participating   Paris Club creditors  reported a  combined end - 2021 debt stock  of  $7.8   billion,  22  percent   higher than the   $6.4  billion  reported to the DRS.  5       IV .   Understanding the  Data Discrepancies between DRS  Debtor  data and Creditor record s    T he  impetus for the data  reconciliation exercise   discussed in this report  was  concerns, widely   expressed by the international community,  about  the ability  of the  world’s  poorer countries  to   manage  their public debt   and  questions as to  whether  the   account of their external liabilities was   accurate and comprehensive.   The  preliminary finding s   of the on going exercise  and gap between   the debtor and creditor figures  may suggest these concerns  are   well - founded.   However, weak   debt management is  only  one of the   reasons for the  discrepanc y   between the data reported by   debtors  to t he DRS  and the comparable   information provided by creditors .  The c hallenges of   aligning  the  datasets  due  to  the  loan/tranche  format  of  reporting    are    discussed  above,   me thodological  inconsistencies     and    some    potential  double - counting     due  to  reporting  of   contingent liabilities   a re  other  key factors.   Some of the   principal issues   regarding the debtor   reports to the DRS and the creditor records are set out below.      Debtor - related  data   issues    ➢   Some  DRS data  is  estimated   not reported by the borrower .   DSSI - eligible  countries  often  strive   to overcome  debt management challenges that translate into limitations on the  capacity to   report viable, timely and comprehensive reports to the DRS .  System fa ilures, f ragility,  natural   disasters,    conflicts     and    crisis  situations  and    exogenous    factors  beyond  their    control    exacerbate these challenges .  In 2021 ,   5   of the se   7 7  IDA - eligible  countries  required to report   to the DRS were unable to meet the  reporting requirement and  countries  such as Syria and   Yemen have not reported for the past  5   years.  In cases of  non - reporting ,   the World Bank debt   team  estimates the DRS data  using other  available  sources of information.     ➢   The d ebtor   may   define  external public debt   more narrowly than  the DRS reporting mandat e.    This is typically  a definition  that includes only borrowing by the central government  and  public   entities that benefits from an explicit  sovereign  guarantee ,   and not the broader  international   definition  of external public debt  used by the DRS and elaborated in  S ection  III .   As such, some   of  State - Owned   Enterprises (SOE s ) external debt liabilities are not reported to the DRS.    ➢   Time lags  in recording  new  commitments   and  loan  disbursements  by national debt offices are   common .  These are reflective of  weak  monitoring procedures  at the national level   and   attributable   to   poor communication, inadequate  human resources ,  delays in entering data   into the debt recording system   and other institutional factors .   These delays have a knock - on   effect on DRS reporting  whi ch may record loan commitments and disbursements a year later   than the creditor record.    ➢   Late interest and penalty interest are rarely reported to the DRS.   Part of the reason for this   lies in lack of understanding of how late and penalty interest is calcula ted, which is often   complex and differs significantly amongst creditors. Limitations in debt management software   which do es   not always  provide   for  the  calculation and recording of interest penalties also   impede reporting.  6       Creditor - related data issues    ➢   Abse nce of a standardized methodology .   Creditors  that  participat e   in the data sharing exercise   all provided information in  accordance with the  agreed  reporting template . However, the data   themselves  are   compiled  in accordance with the national leg islative and  accounting   norms .   These  vary from one creditor to the  other  and   often do not accord to the international   standards and definitions that underpin the DRS ,   thereby  compromising both  intra - creditor   and debtor - creditor comparisons .    ➢   Potential double - countin g   due to the inclusion of contingent liabilities .     Some   creditors    included not only direct bilateral loans   in their reports  but also contingent liabilities . These   include  contingent liabilities  associated with export credit  guarantees   and   financing  of    common funds administered by multilateral institutions   for example the EEC - IDA Special   Account.   A   g uaranteed export credit   is captured in the DRS ,   but  as a direct obligation to the   private  entity that provided the loan .  Similarl y, the EEC - IDA Special Account is   included   in the   DRS  but     as  part  of    the  debtor’s  obligations  to  IDA .  The re     also  appears  to  be    some   overstatement of bilateral debt stocks in cases where a loan is undisbursed or only partially   disbursed but the entire  loan amount is recorded as outstanding .         V. N ext  S teps    The preliminary findings of the report indicate that much more needs to be done to complete the   reconciliation of the end - 2021 data recorded in the DRS with the creditor records. They also   confirm ,   however ,   that  for this work to advance in a meaningful and productive way , it  will require   a much closer interaction with creditors to overcome methodological issues   and   understand   precisel y   how each creditor accounts for their bilateral lending and relat ed debt restructuring and   debt service deferrals so data can be aligned with DRS standards and definitions for purposes  of    comparison.     As next step s ,  the World Bank  will   reach out to each of the participating creditors with the aim of   engaging them in an  open and ongoing dialogue . In doing so ,   it will  draw on the model of working   relations  established  with Japan in 2019 which enabled debtor and creditor data to be aligned   and gaps in the  DRS   records filled.  The   World Bank will also reach out to debtor coun tries with   major data discrepancies to ensure that they will reflect reconciled data  in  their database s   and   debt statistics as needed.     T he World Bank, together with the participating G - 7 and Paris Club creditors, will continue to   advocate the importance of data sharing and  to promote   the exercise  in various fora  to  the    creditors that   have not  yet shared data.

              "0   The preliminary findings from the G-7 and Paris Club countries' debt data sharing exercise, conducted in collaboration with the World Bank, were aimed at enhancing debt transparency, particularly for the world's poorest countries. The exercise was initiated by Japan as a contribution to promoting greater debt transparency. It served as the first step in reconciling debtor-reported information in the World Bank Debtor Reporting System (DRS) with comparable creditor data.\\n\\nComprehensive and transparent public debt data are essential for informed and sustainable borrowing decisions, pricing sovereign risk, and ensuring government accountability. The World Bank has been at the forefront of promoting debt data transparency by collecting and compiling long-series, cross-country comparable data on external debt through the DRS. The DRS aligns with international standards and definitions, allowing for cross-country comparisons and measuring adherence to global norms.\\n\\nThe World Bank's role extends beyond data collection; it also facilitates knowledge transfer on debt measurement, monitoring, and compilation. Additionally, the Bank coordinates with other institutions involved in financial flow information, such as the IMF, OECD, BIS, Commonwealth Secretariat, UNCTAD, and the Paris Club.\\n\\nCreditors play a crucial role in improving debt data quality and transparency. The G-20 endorsed the principles of information sharing and transparency in their Operational Guidelines for Sustainable Financing. However, the effectiveness of data reconciliation exercises depends on timely and transparent disclosure of detailed loan-specific information by creditors.\\n\\nThe G-20 countries provided information to the World Bank on their bilateral claims to IDA-eligible countries in 2020, allowing for the reconciliation of their claims with DRS data. Japan stood out by providing comprehensive loan-by-loan data and engaging in dialogue with the World Bank to resolve discrepancies. This successful outcome prompted Japan to propose a new series of data sharing exercises among G-7 and Paris Club creditors to reconcile data on bilateral loans reported to the DRS. The exercise aimed to validate the accuracy of external debt data, enhance debt transparency, and strengthen debt strategies and sustainability analyses.\\n\\nEighteen creditor countries, including G-7 countries and 11 Paris Club members, participated in the data sharing exercise. The focus was on public sector debt owed to official bilateral creditors, covering all levels of government, central banks, state-owned enterprises, and public entities. A reporting template formulated by the World Bank facilitated the sharing of detailed loan-by-loan information.\\n\\nThe exercise involved comparing basic loan information and end-2021 debt stocks and transactions reported by creditors with DRS data. Reconciliation of loan numbers posed a challenge due to differing reporting norms between debtors and creditors. Despite this challenge, 80% of loans from G-7 countries and 78% of loans from other Paris Club creditors were successfully reconciled.\\n\\nIn terms of debt stocks, creditors reported a total of $62.9 billion at end-2021, 10% higher than the DRS records. The G-7 countries reported a combined end-2021 debt stock of $55.1 billion, while other Paris Club creditors reported $7.8 billion. These findings highlight the importance of data reconciliation to ensure accurate and comprehensive debt reporting.\\n\\nThe data discrepancies identified in the exercise highlight concerns about the ability of poorer countries to manage their public debt and the accuracy of their external liabilities. Further analysis and follow-up are needed to understand the reasons behind these discrepancies and develop measures to address them.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the preliminary findings from the G-7 and Paris Club countries' debt data sharing exercise demonstrate the importance of debt transparency and the role of creditors in improving data quality. The exercise served as a step towards reconciling debtor and creditor records, enhancing debt transparency, and strengthening debt sustainability analyses. However, further efforts are needed to address data discrepancies and ensure accurate and comprehensive debt reporting for the world's poorest countries.  "

Some  creditors  \\nincluded not only direct bilateral loans  in their reports but also contingent liabilities . These \\ninclude contingent liabilities associated with export credit guarantees  and financing of \\ncommon funds administered by multilateral institutions  for example the EEC -IDA Special \\nAccount.  A guaranteed export credit  is captured in the DRS , but as a direct obligation to the \\nprivate entity that provided the loan . Similarl y, the EEC -IDA Special Account is  included  in the \\nDRS but  as part of the debtor’s obligations to IDA . The re also appears to be some \\noverstatement of bilateral debt stocks in cases where a loan is undisbursed or only partially \\ndisbursed but the entire loan amount is recorded as outstanding .  \\n \\nV. Next Steps  \\nThe preliminary findings of the report indicate that much more needs to be done to complete the \\nreconciliation of the end -2021 data recorded in the DRS with the creditor records.

In doing so , it will draw on the model of working \\nrelations established with Japan in 2019 which enabled debtor and creditor data to be aligned \\nand gaps in the DRS records filled. The World Bank will also reach out to debtor coun tries with \\nmajor data discrepancies to ensure that they will reflect reconciled data in their database s and \\ndebt statistics as needed.  \\nThe World Bank, together with the participating G -7 and Paris Club creditors, will continue to \\nadvocate the importance of data sharing and to promote  the exercise in various fora to the \\ncreditors that  have not yet shared data. The World Bank aims to continu e data sharing and \\nreconciliation work with support from a wider group of creditors, including those in the G20, with \\na view to making regular data sharing and reconciliation an established practice.  \\n \n",

But the Liverpool Echo newspaper has said Anfield boss Rafa Benitez will avoid a bidding war and instead turn his attentions to Nicolas Anelka. Real are believed to still want Â£7m before selling Morientes. Monaco are also in the race for the player they had on loan last season. Reports suggest Liverpool will lift their offer to Â£5m - the highest they are willing to go before bowing out of any deal.\\n\\nOn Tuesday, Morientes had said: \"I like Liverpool and I am pleased that a club of their stature want to buy me. I have told Madrid that I want it to happen. \"Madrid know my situation and they know they must do something about me. They must sort out the situation by being sensible. \"I am in a position where I want to play, and I will have to look elsewhere to do that. If Madrid do not want me then it\\'s in the best interests of everyone that they are realistic.\\n\\n\"I haven\\'t spoken to Rafa Benitez but I have always appreciated his work and I would like to play for him. But Benitez could yet turn his attentions to the younger Anelka should Morientes be reluctant to pledge his future to Liverpool. Anelka previously played at Anfield under Gerard Houllier before sealing his permanent switch to Manchester City.\\n'"

But Houllier told BBC Sport: \"In private and in public, I have stressed I believe Rafa is doing a good job. He is the right man at the right place. \"Rafa is a good coach and a good man. I\\'ve spoken to him since he has been at Liverpool and never criticised him.\" Houllier also revealed he is now ready to return to the game after leaving Liverpool in May following six years at Anfield.\\n\\nThe former France boss has been linked with a host of jobs and pulled out of the race to succeed Mark Hughes as Wales national coach. He has been working for Uefa, covering the Premiership for French television and also coaching in Brazil with national coach Carlos Alberto Perreira. Houllier said: \"If a good club comes up at the right time then yes, I am ready to come back. \"It has been interesting to watch games from a different perspective and I have learned things. \"I have been involved in football since leaving Liverpool and my batteries are recharged.\"\\n\\nHoullier has been impressed with the quality in the Premiership after watching as a pundit - particularly with Jose Mourinho\\'s work at leaders Chelsea. He said: \"Chelsea are doing very well. They have some very good creative players in Damien Duff and Arjen Robben and Didier Drogba showed he can change the face of a game when he came on against Newcastle. \"They have got a good team spirit and are strong mentally. They have shown they can cope with all the pressure put on them because of the expectations and cope well with Jose\\'s principles. \"Jose had results before he came to Chelsea and I think he will have an impact in the Premiership because he manages his team very cleverly.\" And Houllier, away from his brief at Liverpool, has been hugely impressed with the Premiership. He said: \"It is a very exciting league. It is entertaining, goals are scored and teams are always trying to win. \"It has been very interesting to watch the game from a different perspective. \"Games switch from end-to-end and there is more pace to the Premiership than other leagues. It is a very good product.\"\\n'"

Mr Cunningham went on to become Tony Blair\\'s \"cabinet enforcer\". He has represented the constituency now known as Copeland since 1970. Mr Blair said he was a \"huge figure\" in Labour and a \"valued, personal friend\".\\n\\nDuring Labour\\'s long period in opposition, Mr Cunningham held a number of shadow roles including foreign affairs, the environment and as trade spokesman. As agriculture minister he caused controversy when he decided to ban beef on the bone in the wake of fears over BSE. He quit the government in 1999 and in recent years has served as the chairman of the all-party committee on Lords reform and has been a loyal supporter of the government from the backbenches.\\n'"
